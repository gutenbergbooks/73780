<p class="ph2">THE OTHER MILLER GIRL</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON a pleasant Saturday afternoon of the latter
part of the September following the awarding of
the Wadsworth prize, Mr. Langley received three
distinct shocks. The first was occasioned by hearing
Miss Penny referred to as an old lady, and the second,
which was almost simultaneous, by learning that Anna
Miller was commonly known as the ‘other Miller
girl.’ The third, which was more subtle, was also
more personal and might have wrought real havoc but
for the slip of a yellow-haired girl who was characterised
thus negatively. Her discovery of this third
shock to Mr. Langley and the action she took led to
such consequences that if it were the fashion now-a-days
to invoke the muse, this history must needs begin
by bidding the goddess sing of the uncommon sense
of the other Miller girl.</p>

<p>The church at Farleigh was a really beautiful building.
It was only an old-fashioned New England
meeting-house, but its proportions were perfect for
its style and its pillared portico was almost as appropriate
to its structure and environment as the chaste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
marble columns of Greece to their more artistic and
romantic setting. It stood on an height truncated by
natural forces to form a plateau and was surrounded
by broad lawns shaded by great English elms and a
single oak-tree.</p>

<p>The greensward was as rich and velvety as if the
season had been midsummer and the foliage of the
trees as luxuriant and almost as bright, on this
Saturday afternoon of the third week of September
when the minister sauntered slowly up the broad walk
leading to the porch. For the summer had been wet:
more than one week had disproved the old saying that
there will always be one fair day in the six to dry the
parson’s shirt. It had been favourable for grass and
trees and uncultivated vegetation but too rainy for
crops. The September sunshine was, however, making
amends; and as he glanced at the picturesque regularity
of the fenced and walled fields of a farm across the
river, Mr. Langley said to himself that the harvest
would be bountiful after all if the frosts held off a
bare fortnight.</p>

<p>The choir had been rehearsing for the morrow and
the women members were lingering in the porch to
chat. The minister had just noticed that Miss Garland,
a member who had been away on a visit in the
West for three months or more, had returned, when
he heard her ask who was staying with old Miss
Penny this winter. It gave him a start to hear Miss
Penny called old, though she hadn’t been a young
woman when he had come to the two villages straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
from theological school, and if he had stopped to
reckon the years he must have realised that she was
well beyond three score and ten. But he did not stop,
for Miss Harriman’s reply gave him another start.</p>

<p>“The other Miller girl,” she said in her high, strong
voice which fortunately lost its nasal twang when she
sang. “Rusty has gone to college, you know, even
though she didn’t get the Wadsworth prize. But this
girl goes to the academy and it seems to me that Miss
Penny ought to have more help than she can give her
outside of school hours, for she has rheumatism so
bad now that she’s almost a cripple.”</p>

<p>Glancing up, the speaker saw that the minister was
upon them and smilingly apprised him of the obvious
fact that Miss Garland had got back. He shook
hands with Miss Garland and with the other three,
questioned the former about her summer and declared
that he should call upon her next week for a fuller
account. Then he turned to Miss Merriman.</p>

<p>“What was that I overheard you saying, Miss
Merriman?” he asked with his slow smile. “Did I
hear you speak of <i>the other</i> Miller girl? And does
that mean Anna?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Langley, Anna Miller. But that is what
everybody in the South Hollow, and for that matter,
in Farleigh, too, I guess, calls her. But she was
away so long that people forgot there was such a person—such
as knew of the family at all—and anyhow,
she seems so different from Rusty. Of course she’s
pretty,—she looks for all the world like a doll,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
everybody says she’s good-natured to a fault. And
there’s something droll about her. And yet——”</p>

<p>The expression of Mr. Langley’s face made her
pause.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Miss Merriman,” he said whimsically
but at the same time rather wistfully, “at this
moment it seems to me that to be supremely good-natured
and somewhat droll is a triumph in itself.”</p>

<p>He smiled and sighed.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, life in the two villages will seem
different without Rusty,” he owned. “It will be
quieter, but doubtless far less exciting.”</p>

<p>He went into the church to fetch a book, then overtook
Miss Garland and walked with her as far as the
post office. And as they went, he asked her why she
thought of Miss Penny as old; and they occupied the
time recollecting dates and computing the passing of
the years. And both felt older at parting, and one
of them strangely depressed.</p>

<p>Just as Miss Penny had long realised that people
called her an old lady so Anna Miller was quite aware
that she was known as the ‘other Miller girl.’ But
the younger resented the fact as little as the older.
Anna adored her sister, looked up to her in many
ways, and never dreamed of disputing or questioning
her title as virtual head of the family. The girl
knew, too, that she was pretty and in doll-fashion,
though she didn’t herself consider doll-fashion bad.
If the question had come up, she would have acknowledged
promptly, too, that she was good-humored, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
she couldn’t help realising that people thought her
droll. Nevertheless, vain as she undoubtedly was,
Anna Miller did not attach undue weight to any of
these qualities, and otherwise would have been likely
to rate her own powers lower than anyone else would
have done. Enjoying life thoroughly, and perhaps
more consciously than is usual at her years, she was
quite content to be the ‘other Miller girl’ and to endeavor
to stop any portion she might of the gap left
in hearts and households by Rusty’s absence.</p>

<p>But the girl was herself quite unconscious and
others quite unaware of her most valuable characteristic.
Young as she was, Anna Miller had one
quality seldom gained before middle age, and rare
even then,—a truly humourous outlook upon the
world. The girl viewed life and her fellow human
beings almost in the detached manner of a philosopher,
yet warmly and sympathetically withal. She
enjoyed oddities and idiosyncrasies which annoyed or
vexed others and made allowance for larger faults
with a singularly mature tolerance. She was one of
the few who habitually demand less than they are
willing to proffer,—simply and naturally and quite
without any sense of superiority.</p>

<p>Experience had made Anna Miller prematurely
middle-aged in her grasp of reality,—experience acting
upon that endowment of good nature which everyone
granted her. Running away as a child from the
dreary, shiftless household that had been her home,
for five years the girl had supported herself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
great city to which she had fled, to the extent of keeping
soul and body together, successively as errand girl
to a dressmaker, as bundle and cash-girl, and finally
as sales-girl in a department store. But all the while
something within her—perhaps the adventurous instinct
that had hurtled her forth—had responded to
the clarion which is within the din of every struggle.
She had known the extremes of heat and cold, of
loneliness and hunger, but she had made light of
them. She had clung to her shred of vanity, masquerading
on an empty stomach, and cheering long
hours in her cramped, dreary hall-bedroom arranging
her tangle of pale yellow hair in various fashions
before her tiny cracked mirror, trying on scraps of
finery, and coquetting with the reflection which was
always picturesque no matter how absurdly arrayed.
She had ‘bluffed’ her way through the lean, meagre
years, her shockingly slangy expression being a veritable
gospel of cheer to her fellow clerks and lodgers,
and the snatches of ugly popular songs on her lips,
real melody which echoed in her own heart as well as
in theirs. And she had ‘won out’ triumphantly with
her natural sweetness of disposition not only unimpaired
but strengthened and enriched, with a keenness
of mind which is one of the ends of education, and
with that curiously mature and humourous outlook
instead of the bitterness which might have been
expected.</p>

<p>On the day following that on which Mr. Langley
had first heard her referred to as the other Miller girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Anna was in her usual place in Miss Penny’s pew at
the opening of the Sunday morning service. She was
rather preoccupied by her new suit. Rusty had had
to have a new one when she went to college, and she
had insisted upon Anna’s having one at the same time.
Rusty’s was brown, the peculiar russet shade that
matched her hair exactly and was peculiarly Rusty’s,
loose in the jacket, and plain. Anna’s was green,
more elaborate than Rusty’s and not in nearly so good
taste, as Anna knew well. But it was exceedingly
smart and very becoming and the girl was, as she
declared, ‘crazy over it.’ Clever with her fingers, she
had made a green velvet hat to match the suit, a
three-cornered affair which did not fall far short of
being utterly absurd, but which, set jauntily upon her
riotous yellow hair, certainly made her little doll-face
bewitching.</p>

<p>Anna had a very sweet voice and had been asked to
join the choir, and during the anthem, she fixed her
long-lashed blue eyes seriously upon the women members,
studying, not their voices nor their manner of
using their vocal organs, but their attitude and demeanour.
As she saw herself in fancy standing behind
the low railing in her new green suit and ‘nifty’ hat,
she wondered if it wouldn’t be an exceedingly pleasant
change for the congregation to have a younger person
to gaze upon and one who had more regard for the
current fashions. And dear me! Every blooming
member of the present choir had hair of the same
colour, something between brown and drab. Anna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
said to herself that when she should stand up among
them to sing, if her long yellow braid with the curl
at the end did not of its own accord flop over her
shoulder, she would flop it,—it stood out so picturesquely
against the green. Here in the pew, of course,
it was just as well to let it hang down her back, for
Miss Penny sat very near the pulpit.</p>

<p>So near, indeed, that she was directly in front of
Mr. Langley,—which reflection induced another that
when she should sit with the choir, Mr. Langley
couldn’t see her at all. That seemed a pity, and yet—Anna
wondered if he saw her now,—saw her, that
is, not as a soul but as a young girl in a new suit,
with yellow hair shining like pale gold against it. He
might possibly notice the latter, for his beloved little
Ella May, who had died before the Millers had come
to Farleigh, had had long golden curls.</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl recalled her roving gaze. Mr.
Langley was preaching, and Anna hadn’t even heard
the text! It was right down mean, she said to herself,
when anyone worked as hard as he did to write
such beautiful sermons for people not to listen to
every single word. He didn’t write absolutely new
sermons, indeed, he had so many on hand after preaching
here for years and years and years; but they were
new to the greater part of the congregation and practically
so to all of them, for he worked over them,
added new matter and quoted from new poems whose
authors had been at school or in their cradles when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the sermons were first composed. Moreover they
were quite fresh to Anna.</p>

<p>Though her mental equipment was haphazard,
Anna Miller had a certain power of concentration.
To-day, however, she had no sooner fixed her eyes
resolutely upon the minister than her thoughts began
to wander again. For it came to the girl suddenly
and startlingly that Mr. Langley was changed—yes,
greatly changed. He looked tired, but it was worse
than that: he looked as if he had lost something.
There seemed no longer to be any <i>springiness</i> about
him. He was like a jack-in-the-box that has been so
mishandled that when you open the lid he doesn’t
jump out at you but only flaps feebly. Mr. Langley
was too young to have his springs go flat. He had
only a few grey hairs. He was tall and slim and
straight and graceful and really much handsomer
than that floor-walker at Martin and Mason’s that
had been so stuck on himself.</p>

<p>Glancing hurriedly back over his life as she knew
it by hearsay, Anna felt it to have been unusually placid
and untroubled. Of course it had been a terrible
grief to him losing his little girl, that golden-haired
little Ella May who had gone about through the two
villages scattering sunshine. But that had happened
years ago and he had seemed happy and young until
now. Then it came to her that this was, perhaps,
Ella May’s birthday. Perhaps he had it all to go
through again every year as the day came round?</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, Anna appeared suddenly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the parlour, which was seldom used excepting on
Sunday, briskly polishing a goblet with a cross-barred
dish towel.</p>

<p>“O Miss Penny, tell me, when did Ella May die?”
she asked. “Was it the twenty-second day of September?”</p>

<p>“O no, Anna, she died on the twenty-eighth day
of December,” Miss Penny returned promptly and
in some surprise. And although the storms of more
than a score of winters had yellowed the tiny marble
lamb upon the little grave in the cemetery on the
hillside where the minister’s baby had been laid, probably
every adult person in the parish could have given
the date as readily.</p>

<p>Anna returned to the kitchen. Passing the mirror,
she paused and gazed at her own image. She shook
her head ruefully. Even with her festive blouse and
smart skirt covered by her checked gingham overall,
she was a picture, and after all, her hair looked as
pale golden against this dull ground. Hastily gathering
an handful of wet silver, she returned to the
parlour.</p>

<p>“She had golden curls, didn’t she, Miss Penny—little
Ella May?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Long, golden ringlets and deep blue eyes,” asseverated
Miss Penny in the tone she used only in speaking
of the dead.</p>

<p>“Well, was her birthday in September?”</p>

<p>“Why Anna Miller! She was born on Christmas-day—O
my dear child, it must have been twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
years ago this next Christmas day, for I was fifty
myself at the time and I am seventy-five now. That
was the year I had my plum-coloured moreen—you
remember the under side of the cushion in grandma’s
old chair up in Reuben’s room? Sarah Pettingill
made it, and I wore it to the Christmas tree for the
first time and word came while we were there that
Mr. Langley had the finest gift in the world—a little
daughter. Some of the ladies wanted him to call her
Christmas and he said he’d like to have her named
Carol, but she was called for his wife after all. Her
maiden name was May.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley was so little a personality in the mind
of the girl that it seemed incongruous in her to have
had a maiden name. As she would have asked a
careless question in regard to her, however, she looked
up to see Miss Penny’s face drawn with dismay.</p>

<p>“Dear me, I know I am old, but I didn’t think I
was losing my memory,” Miss Penny cried. “It
comes to me all of a sudden that I wore that plum-coloured
dress to the child’s funeral. I remember distinctly
my mother’s telling me that plum-colour was
next door to purple and that purple was light mourning
and quite suitable for a young person’s funeral.”</p>

<p>“But you could have worn it to both,” declared
Anna. “You keep your clothes so well that it probably
looked new for the funeral.”</p>

<p>“But Anna, my aunt Penny died the February after
that dress was made and mother and I coloured it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
black for the funeral. And she died twenty-five years
ago the tenth of February.”</p>

<p>“Then it couldn’t be the Christmas that Ella May
was born that you had it, but the one before her death.
I’m glad it wasn’t, for I don’t like her to be so old.”</p>

<p>“But if the little thing wasn’t born that year, I’m
sure I don’t know when she <i>was</i> born,” remarked
Miss Penny plaintively.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to find out,” said Anna cheerfully.
“Anyhow, I’m glad it wasn’t the twenty-second of
September. I got to thinking of it at church and it
sort of—got on my nerves.”</p>

<p>Returning to her work, she couldn’t get Mr. Langley
and the mysterious, lamentable alteration in him off
her mind. Ella May might have nothing to do with
it—and then again she might. In any event, the first
thing to be done was to learn the age of the child at
the time of her death. She was just wondering
whether she had time to go over to the cemetery that
afternoon, when Miss Penny called her. Going into
the parlour, she found Mrs. Phelps, their next-door
neighbour.</p>

<p>“O Anna, what do you think?” cried Miss Penny
in great excitement. “Mrs. Phelps says that Ella
May Langley was only three days old when she died.
She can prove it!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANNA MILLER gasped. But she recovered herself
immediately.</p>

<p>“Well then, you were right about the plum-coloured
moreen, Miss Penny. It served for the christening
and the funeral just like the baked meats in <i>Hamlet</i>
that coldly furnished forth the wedding-feast,” she
commented. “Only—this is what gets me. How
about those golden ringlets?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me! I cannot understand!” cried
Miss Penny in dismay. “Even now I seem to see that
little thing as plain as day, toddling along beside Mr.
Langley, in her fine white dress with the lace frill at
the neck pressed down by those lovely long curls. I
suppose I dreamed it.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, Miss Penny, most everybody in the
church feels just about so,” remarked her neighbour.</p>

<p>She turned to Anna. “As I said to Miss Penny, the
reason I am so sure about it all is because the marble
lamb on their lot in the cemetery on Ella May’s grave
was the last thing my cousin Alfred ever did. Mrs.
Langley was so particular that it should be copied
from life from a lamb that was just three days old
same as the baby was when she passed away that
Albert had to wait until spring to do it. He went off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
on a farm up in the hills beyond Marsden and stayed
over two nights to make his sketches. He took to his
bed that spring and never did another stroke of marble
work. Mrs. Langley was more than satisfied
with the monument and had it photographed and
framed. The last I heard—which wasn’t very lately—the
photograph stood on the marble-topped stand
in her room close to her bed.”</p>

<p>Anna’s eyes grew round. It seemed strange to
hear Mrs. Phelps speak of Mrs. Langley as a person.
Until to-day she had been hardly so much as a dim
vision, a mere word, this woman who had been an
invalid for more years than Anna had lived. She
seemed far less a person than Ella May. And now
to think of her—or to try to stretch her mind to
think of her as Ella May’s mother and Mr. Langley’s
wife gave the girl an uncanny feeling. And she
couldn’t mention her in the present tense.</p>

<p>“What was she like, Mrs. Phelps?” she asked in an
hushed manner.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Langley? O Anna, don’t ask me!” protested
Mrs. Phelps. “She was pretty with soft dark
eyes and fine brown hair the last time I saw her, but
that was twenty-odd years ago.”</p>

<p>“My goodness! Hasn’t anyone seen her since?”
asked Anna.</p>

<p>“It has been years and years, I don’t know just
how many, since the last outsider saw her. She had
neuralagy in her face and headache. The last I knew
she had had one headache for ten years. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
know whether that one is still going on or whether
she had begun on another.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Mr. Langley sees her?” Anna asked.</p>

<p>“I believe he goes in once a day—he used to. But
Bell Adams that keeps house for him takes care of
Mrs. Langley and I guess she’s the only one that ever
really sees her.”</p>

<p>Anna betook herself to the porch. Understanding
had come to her. Poor Mr. Langley! He, too, had
played with the vision of the golden-haired little
daughter; all these years he had kept himself young
with the image of his little girl in his heart. Most
likely he hadn’t thought of her as of any particular
age—just a darling little girl. But now, since last
Sunday,—since Wednesday, indeed, some idiot had
reminded him that she would have been a grown-up
young lady at this time. Anna could fairly see him
shrinking, cowering before the appalling fact. Then
he had taken a great leap headlong to overtake a
daughter twenty-five years old!</p>

<p>What a pity! What a calamity, indeed! How
would he ever get through the remainder of his life
with his poor heart all flattened out and his vision
forever shattered? But no one could bring the baby
back nor could anyone halt or turn back the revolving
years. Everything moved relentlessly on towards old
age excepting that little marble lamb that would
remain just three days old to the end of time.</p>

<p>But the marble lamb recalled Mrs. Langley, and
suddenly Anna seemed to see a ray of light. Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Langley had been dead to the minister almost as long
as the baby, and yet she wasn’t hopelessly dead. Suppose
she were to be restored to him? There must
have been something very dear about one who had
insisted upon the little symbolic image’s being copied
from a baby lamb just three days old, and if she still
kept the photograph beside her in her loneliness and
pain, she must herself be a lovely creature with the
added saintliness of the years of patient suffering. If
she could be restored to Mr. Langley, a sweet girl-wife,
would not the weight of years that had suddenly
pounced down upon him take instant flight?
One was always hearing of people who had been bed-ridden
for years getting well, and Mrs. Langley wasn’t
so bad as bed-ridden. ‘Neuralagy’ and sleeplessness
and headache and the like were what ailed her, and
youth saw no reason why these should not be speedily
banished. Quite likely it might have been put through
long since had anyone taken the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Anna grinned as she said to herself she would now
be Charley on-the-spot. Mr. Langley had been goodness
itself to Rusty and their father—to all the family,
indeed. He was putting Rusty through college. Her
mother and the boys worshipped him; and Anna herself
really owed him most of all. For she had
deserted her family for five years, coming back to
find a quite different and to her ideal home, a changed
father and mother and a wonderful sister—and all
through Mr. Langley. In any case, Anna said to
herself she would have wanted to do what she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
going to do (she didn’t know how or even exactly
<i>what</i> as yet); but as it was, she simply <i>had</i> to do it.</p>

<p>That evening when she and Miss Penny were having
their tea, Miss Penny asked her how she happened
to be thinking of Ella May that day.</p>

<p>“I noticed that Mr. Langley looked sort of sad
this morning at church, and I was trying to scare up
a reason,” Anna returned.</p>

<p>“Sad!” cried Miss Penny in real distress. “O
Anna!”</p>

<p>“Well, tired, perhaps,” the girl amended.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose, Anna, that it can be because of
his lifting me in and out of the phaeton every Sunday?”
Miss Penny asked almost tragically. “If I
thought it was that, I wouldn’t go to meeting at all—though
I should miss it—I don’t know how I should
get along without it. And then he might be hurt.
Or—I suppose I could get that Luke Thompson—not
his brother, you know—to help me. He isn’t very
bright, and yet—I hardly know whether I could offer
him money. And yet how could I ask him unless I
did? And I should have to explain to Mr. Langley—but
so I should if I stayed at home. Only——”</p>

<p>“I could lift you myself. I could run three times
round the house with you in my arms,” Anna assured
her. “It’s nothing at all to Mr. Langley. He’s got
muscle to burn. I didn’t mean that. I meant—I don’t
know exactly, but I believe he’s tired at heart after
all these years of well-doing. I’ll tell you what his
expression this morning makes me think of—pa’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Aunt Marthy he’s always telling of who was taken
with her last sickness in the dead of winter and had
a terrible hankering for dandelion greens. She said
she knew she’d get well if she could have just one
mess of ’em—and the snow three feet deep on the
ground. And when it came to the end and they asked
her if she had any last wishes, she said: ‘Thank you
kindly, I could relish a mess of dandelions.’ And
while she was waiting for them, she died.”</p>

<p>“We’re all more or less like that, wanting something
or other beyond our reach,” commented Miss
Penny with a smile and a sigh, “But I shouldn’t think
it of Mr. Langley.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, Miss Penny, I believe I’ll run in to
see Mrs. Langley some day soon,” Anna remarked.</p>

<p>Miss Penny looked as if she believed Anna had
suddenly gone mad.</p>

<p>“She might take to me where she didn’t to other
people—some do, you know,” the girl went on coolly.
“And some people like just to look at me—on account
of my hair, I dare say, for otherwise I’m not much to
look at. It’s a yard long, you know, if I pull it out
perfectly straight.”</p>

<p>“Anna, dear, there are moments when I almost
think you are vain,” said Miss Penny smiling. “But
listen to me, child. Reuben stayed at the parsonage
for weeks after his father passed away, and Mrs.
Langley would never see him even once. And he was
the sweetest little fellow! Mr. Langley would have
liked to keep him, but of course he couldn’t under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the circumstances. And so—you know how it all
came about that he came here, don’t you, Anna?”</p>

<p>“I have heard it many a time. It’s one of pa’s
favourite yarn. But it’s a good story and worth
repeating just the same,” Anna returned.</p>

<p>The girl’s last waking thought was of standing by
the invalid’s couch bathing her aching brow with
cologne-water. But in the course of the following
week she learned that Mrs. Langley had acquired the
reputation of being extremely formidable. Big Bell,
as Bell Adams, the tall, large-boned, hard-featured but
good-natured housekeeper was called, cherished considerable
affection for her mistress but gave Anna no
encouragement whatever. When she hinted that it
might be well for her to see someone, Bell was horrified
and aghast. It was as much as ever, she declared,
that Mrs. Langley would see her own husband for
two minutes a day.</p>

<p>Admitting that visiting Mrs. Langley would be no
<i>cinch</i>, the girl was nevertheless undaunted. It wasn’t
natural for her to live in that way. If she weren’t
lonely, she ought to be; if she were not wretched, it
was because there were no extremes in her life—only
one dead level of headache and <i>neuralagy</i>. And constantly
Anna came back to the realisation that there was
something to appeal to in a woman who had thought
of having the three days old lamb carved and who had
cherished the picture of it all these years.</p>

<p>Finally she decided to see the image itself and
receive, it might be, some inspiration or suggestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
for making a beginning. She learned the location of
the minister’s lot and set off secretly early Saturday
afternoon.</p>

<p>The cemetery, which overlooked the whole valley
of the river, was a retired, lonely place, hedged in by
evergreen, yet not without beauty. Anna had been
vaguely perplexed and anxious, but the serenity of the
place soothed her, and she made straight for the minister’s
lot with a subdued eagerness of expectation that
was almost adventurous.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw it from a distance, the tiny baby
lamb with its feet folded neatly beneath it. So little
and quaint and homely it was, that the girl stilled a
cry, a little motherly murmur of pity, as if the tiny
creature were alive and had been left here lonely
through all the long years. And running, she dropped
down on her knees beside it to fondle it.</p>

<p>Then she shrank back and caught her breath
sharply, almost in a sob. It was as if, believing it to
be alive, she had found it dead. One side of the
marble was sadly discoloured. It was so blackened
indeed as to be quite defaced and ugly, to have lost
all its symbolism and significance and to have become
an hideous caricature. Suddenly the other Miller girl,
who seldom shed tears, covered her face and wept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. LANGLEY was nearer fifty than forty,
though only by a little. He was, in a way,
‘settled’ in his habits. He liked and affected, on all
days save the Sabbath, old clothes and old shoes,
though both were always scrupulously neat, and his
shabbiness was never otherwise than picturesque and
attractive. Though he went about constantly among
his people, he led a lonely, pensive life in the big,
empty, shabby parsonage, almost as little aware, it
would seem, of the existence of his invalid wife as
were his parishioners who practically thought of him
as a bachelor. And truly, since his wife had taken to
her room upwards of twenty years ago, and shut herself
out from everyone, he had been almost as literally
widowed as if she, too, lay in the enclosure marked by
the little marble lamb in the cemetery on the hillside.</p>

<p>For all that, Russell Langley had still somehow
kept intact through all the years the heart of youth—almost
of boyhood. Not that his parishioners were
aware of it, except indirectly. Most of them regarded
their beloved pastor and bore themselves towards him
as if he had something like three score years to his
credit—or debit. The boys and girls, it is true, the
children and even the babies found him singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
companionable,—but so did the very oldest. The
greybeards of the congregation and those who were
contemporaries of Russell Langley’s grandparents
talked to him as they would have talked to the latter
had they been living and had their lines been cast in
Farleigh instead of in Albany, New York. His youthful
appearance impressed them only in the sense that
he was a fine figure in the pulpit and a graceful presiding
officer in the town hall whenever the services
of such an one were required. His tall, slim, indolently
erect figure was attributed to the fact that he
had played base-ball at college, and the lack of lines in
his face to freedom from family cares. For, when
all is said, an invalid wife whom a clergyman sees
no more frequently than an invalid parishioner and
with whom he holds no conversation whatever is
scarcely to be classed among family cares.</p>

<p>It was only the other Miller girl who recognised
the elusive quality that made up a large part of the
charm which everyone felt in the man. Likewise when
this quality had taken flight, temporarily or irretrievably,
it was Anna Miller who guessed the secret of its
loss. Everyone knew that the minister had never
forgotten his little daughter who had died. Ella May’s
name was constantly upon his lips. But Anna said
to herself that the light of enthusiasm in his eye and
the buoyancy of his step had been largely due to the
thought of a child toddling or tripping along beside
him.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he had lost her, had lost his child-companion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and with her the spirit of youth. Someone
must have said to him—some <i>idiot</i>, some <i>gump</i>,
some <i>galoot</i>, the girl reflected indignantly—that Ella
May would have been—was it possible that she would
have been twenty-five if she had lived? Twenty-five!
Poor Mr. Langley! He couldn’t tote a person of
twenty-five around with him leading her by the hand.
It must have been a terrible shock to him to reach
out for the golden-haired child and see a tall young
lady with her hair put up and a college education!
No wonder that he had grown old overnight, that his
youth had fallen from him as if it had been something
material, a mantle of slippery silk that had
dropped from his shoulders at the loosing of a clasp.</p>

<p>Ah! but he should have it back. He should recapture
it, the Reverend Russell Langley should, before
it was beyond recall. He would renew his youth in
the companionship of his youthful wife. Mrs. Langley
was nearly forty-five, but she wouldn’t look over
thirty at the most—probably not over twenty-five.
And twenty-five in a wife is quite another thing than
in a daughter. It was work and care and fuss and
bother that made people grow old, and she hadn’t done
a thing or had a care for nearly twenty-five years.
Mrs. Langley had, as it were, lain upon rose leaves,
gazed at the little pictured lamb (that was, alas! so
much fairer than the marble image) and thought of all
sorts of sweet and lovely things. She had suffered
pain, of course, but that is refining and would only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
add a pensive, perhaps mournful charm to her flower-like
beauty.</p>

<p>A week from the day of her visit to the minister’s
lot in the cemetery, Mr. Langley passed the Miller
house, bound for a conference at the academy, and the
other Miller girl set forth for Farleigh, of which village
the South Hollow was one end. As she drew near the
parsonage, she saw a blue haze of smoke coming from
the chimney of the summer kitchen. That meant that
Big Bell was at work in that remote part of the house,
and Anna’s feet flew.</p>

<p>As she came to a lane which extended a few rods
from the avenue which was the main street of the
village to a pine grove which was originally the western
boundary of a large farm, she glanced up absently.
The one house in the lane had been vacant during the
summer, but within a few weeks a mother and daughter,
a rather mysterious pair, had moved into it. Now
she saw a young girl, who was dark and looked handsome
in an haughty fashion, on the steps. Anna
waved her hand in a friendly way. The girl inclined
her small head proudly, rose and went into the
cottage.</p>

<p>“I do believe she’s mad because I haven’t been in
to see her,” Anna said to herself in dismay. “She’s
about my age and I’m the one who would naturally
do it. Of course, they wouldn’t let Mr. Langley in,
but I’m different. Nobody would mind a little thing
like me.”</p>

<p>She was tempted to run up the lane and tap at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
door. But this afternoon was pledged to Mr. Langley
and his girl-wife, and Anna regretfully left the lane
behind her.</p>

<p>She opened the parsonage gate softly. If she could
elude Bell the way was clear, for the front door stood
open, and of course the screen door wouldn’t be
fastened. Creeping up the walk, she tried it gently.
It did not yield. Peeping in, she could just make out
that it was hooked.</p>

<p>As she stood irresolute, she noticed a loose place
where the wire netting was tacked to the wooden
frame of door. It was too late for June-bugs, but
the season was still like summer and if there were
any chance, moth millers would fly in by the score as
soon as the lamps were lighted and commit suicide in
their harrowing way. Poor things! It seemed wicked
to entice them to destruction.</p>

<p>But there was no other way. Boldly the girl poked
her finger through the aperture, tearing the netting
ruthlessly until she could reach the hook and raise it.
Then, withdrawing her scratched and bleeding hand,
she opened the door softly and stole in, only to be
immediately seized and oppressed by a sensation of
guilt and even of fright. Pausing only a moment,
however, she made her way noiselessly down the
passage to the door of the room she knew to be that
of the minister’s wife. It was ajar and she knocked
timidly.</p>

<p>Absolute silence save for the loud ticking of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
clock and the yet louder beating of her heart. Screwing
her courage, Anna knocked again.</p>

<p>“Bell?” called out a strange, hoarse voice that
accorded ill with the vision of the girl-wife.</p>

<p>“No’m. It’s me—Anna. It’s the other Miller girl—Rusty’s
sister, you know,” murmured Anna faintly.
“Please may I come in? I want to—tell you something.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, she pushed the
door wide and entered a large, bare, gloomy looking
chamber, darkened and musty-smelling though one
window was open a few inches. For a minute she
stood motionless, unable to make out anything clearly
in the dimness. Then, as suddenly as if a blind had
been raised or a match struck she saw the dark figure
of the minister’s wife dimly silhouetted against the
dun background.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley—if indeed it were Mrs. Langley?—had
raised herself from the cushions of a padded
arm chair and was staring at the intruder in mingled
amazement and horror. And the girl, her heart in
her mouth, stood as if transfixed and stared back. It
was as if she had heard a tremendous explosion or
witnessed a silent one (as one does in a dream) and
found herself standing in the midst of a mass of
wreckage—which might have been the shattered fragments
of the bottle of cologne-water with which she
had in fancy bathed the white brow of the pale, romantic
invalid she had pictured.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_026">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="Please, may I come in?">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Please, may I come in? I want to—tell you something.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This woman’s figure, outlined against the lowered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
blind, was that of a witch, the shoulders being curved
almost in an hump and the emaciated profile resembling
the terrible nutcracker contour commonly associated
with the broomstick. Her dark hair, streaked
with yellowish grey, was strained back from her yellow
face into a tight little wad on the back of her
head. Her lips were colourless, her cheeks appallingly
hollow. Her sunken eyes, set in deep, greenish
cavities, burned fiercely beneath her frowning brow.
She looked as old and ugly as a sybil and to Anna as
wicked.</p>

<p>It was she who first recovered sufficiently to speak.</p>

<p>“Who are you and WHAT are you doing in my
room?” she demanded in a voice that made the girl
say to herself ‘Hark from the tomb!’ and gain thereby
a bit of audacity.</p>

<p>“I’m the other Miller girl, Rusty’s sister,” she faltered.
“I just thought—I’d come——”</p>

<p>But she could not go on.</p>

<p>“Are you mad? Are you stark, staring crazy?”
challenged the old woman whom Anna couldn’t believe
to be the minister’s wife. As she spoke, large gaps
on either side of her front teeth explained the unnatural
hollows in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“N-no, I guess not. I’m only—sort of <i>fresh</i>,” the
girl gasped.</p>

<p>“Did Bell let you in?”—still more fiercely.</p>

<p>“O no, I let myself in,” Anna returned, and as the
fierce dark eyes bored into her she seemed forced to
confess the whole enormity of her action as if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
had been a naughty child. “I poked my finger in and
made a hole in the screen, but I don’t believe it’ll matter—it’s
so late,—the season, I mean.”</p>

<p>“If you are not crazy, what do you mean by breaking
into people’s houses and disturbing the sick?”
demanded the old woman. “Don’t you know that I
haven’t seen anyone except the doctor for twenty-three
years?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-three—that’s <i>skidoo</i>,” murmured Anna
under her breath and caught another bit of spirit.
Withdrawing her gaze, not without difficulty, from the
face before her, she glanced about her, half fearfully,
half boldly. A marble-topped table next the chair in
which the invalid huddled was covered with bottles,
apothecaries’ boxes and medicine glasses. In their
midst, a photograph in a velvet frame stood upright
by means of a support at the back. As the girl’s eye
encountered this, on a sudden she knew it was the
little lamb, and her fear took wings. Quite bold now,
she went straight up to Mrs. Langley, held out her
hand—which was ignored—and smiled ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>“The little marble lamb up in the cemetery,” she
murmured softly, “I went to see it. I thought you
would like to know—that is, I thought you would
want to know that it’s all turned black and yellow and
mildewed, and——”</p>

<p>“What!” the woman almost shrieked.</p>

<p>“The little lamb—the cunning little marble lamb on
Ella May’s grave with its little legs tucked under it
like a baby kitten,—it’s all black and—slimy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Mrs. Langley fell back among the cushions.</p>

<p>“My baby! My baby!” she cried, and the genuine
pain in the harsh voice awaked the girl’s pity. “Has
no one looked after it? O, I might have known! I
might have known!”</p>

<p>As she looked beseechingly at Anna, she seemed
to see her for the first time.</p>

<p>“Sit down, little girl,” she said, and her voice
though not pleasant was less harsh.</p>

<p>Pity contending with shrinking, Anna fetched a
chair and seated herself beside the table bearing the
bottles and the photograph. As she fixed her eyes on
the latter, the woman in the chair gazed at her. She
had had no glimpse of youth, of young life, for more
than twenty years, and it might not have been strange
if this slip of a girl with her long-lashed demure blue
eyes, her charming, peaked little face and her riotous
yellow hair that almost seemed to light up the dark
chamber, had appeared a supernatural visitant. She
made an apparent effort to collect herself, to marshal
forces that had been dormant for so many years as
almost to have become non-existent.</p>

<p>“It was—good of you to tell me,” she croaked. “Is
it—ruined?”</p>

<p>“O no, indeed, one side of it is as good as ever,
or nearly. A marble man could mend it up slick, I’m
sure. But Mrs. Phelps’ cousin Alfred isn’t Charley-on-the-spot
any longer because he cashed in right after
he made it.”</p>

<p>The invalid grasped only the first sentence. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
should hate to have it—scraped,” she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I get you. So should I,” the girl responded eagerly.
“Of course you know that it isn’t alive, but you can’t
help feeling all the time just as if it were—those darling
little sticks of legs tucked in under so naturally
and all that. I shouldn’t want it scraped, either.
Promise not to let on if I tell you something?”</p>

<p>The invalid looked as if she would have smiled if
she hadn’t long since forgotten how.</p>

<p>“I promise,” she said in a voice which indicated the
weary while since she had relaxed her terrible grimness.</p>

<p>“Well, when I saw it, so little and cunning and
helpless, and then saw—what had happened to it, out
there all alone, I just cried. I couldn’t help it, honestly.”</p>

<p>As she looked at the girl, tears came to the invalid’s
eyes. The hand which held her pocket handkerchief
to them was like a yellow claw, but they were less
sharp when she removed it.</p>

<p>“O, don’t you feel badly about it, please, please,”
Anna begged. “I’ll tell you what—I’ll clean it all up
slick. I can use sand soap and all sorts of lightning
cleaners. I’ll get someone to put me wise about cleaning
marble without letting on what it’s for.”</p>

<p>“O, if you only would!” cried the invalid looking
and speaking more like Red-Riding-Hood’s wolf than
like the girl-wife Anna had dreamed of restoring to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
her husband (who might be this woman’s son or
grandson).</p>

<p>“I hope—I didn’t frighten you?”</p>

<p>“I was a bit fazed, but I shouldn’t be again,” Anna
admitted as she rose. Then she caught her breath
sharply at the thought of there being an <i>again</i>. And
after all, why should there be? Though she couldn’t
help being sorry for her, there was nothing she could
do with that sort of person. Surely she couldn’t wish
that sort of wife upon poor Mr. Langley!</p>

<p>“And you will tell me how you get along?” the
other asked.</p>

<p>“Come here, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Mrs. Langley responded so promptly
that Anna couldn’t help feeling how elated she must
have been if the invalid had been the invalid of her
fancy. She felt a bit indignant as she asked herself
why, with absolutely nothing to do for twenty years
and no real illness, this woman couldn’t at least have
kept her figure and her complexion. “How soon can
you do it, little girl?” Mrs. Langley added.</p>

<p>“Not before next Saturday, for I’m in school—the
academy. So you see I’m not what you’d call a little
girl. Well—so long.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand. The hand of the invalid
was cold and clammy, besides being like a claw, and
as she let herself out, on a sudden Anna shivered. The
yellow face with its cavernous eyes, the sunken mouth,
the gaping teeth, the claw-like grasp of her hand,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> 
girl made a wild dash to get away from it all only
to ran violently into Mr. Langley, who was coming
slowly up the walk with bent head.</p>

<p>Apologising in profound distress, as if it had been
his fault, he asked Anna if she had been looking for
him, that being the sole reason that anyone but the
doctor ever came to the parsonage.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” faltered the girl oppressed by a sudden
and awful sense of guilt towards him, “I came to
see—your wife.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Anna?” he demanded looking at her
as if he doubted her sanity or his own sense of
hearing.</p>

<p>“I’ve been—visiting with your wife,” the girl said
and laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>With a startled face, he pushed by her into the
house. And only then Anna realised the whole force
of the situation, the ugly, naked fact. She—that terrible
old woman who was really an old hag, was Mr.
Langley’s wife!</p>

<p>She began to run, wildly, blindly, pursued by the
terrible vision. She did not see the girl who lived in
the lane come forth into the avenue on an errand,
and ran directly into her arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">REUBEN CARTWRIGHT’S father had built the
house in the lane at Farleigh, and one who had
known Dick Cartwright well would have said the
cottage was like him. There was something odd and
unusual about it which gave it a peculiar charm without
making it startling or bizarre; and something of
his whimsicality seemed to have crept into the arrangement
of nooks and corners and cupboards and bookcases.
Oddest of all was the living-room, which was
disproportionately large and contained a good-sized
platform, raised three feet or more above the floor,
which was to have held the pipe organ which the
years were to have brought. But the years, instead of
bringing the pipe organ, fame and other desiderata,
material and otherwise, had taken away from Dick
Cartwright his greatest blessing, his wife and sweet-heart
whose presence and companionship had been
the necessary conditions of fulfilling and enjoying
his dreams. And after her death, the quaint cottage
with the platform for the organ and the odd bits of
furniture he had made and carved were only a mockery
to Dick Cartwright. He had his little boy, it is
true, who was very like his mother, and he had Mr.
Langley as an intimate friend; but he could not forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Jessie and he took to drink to ease the torture remembrance
was. Whereupon he forgot not only Jessie
but their child and his duty as well. He lost his place
as organist at Farleigh church and as book-keeper at
one of the banks at Wenham. And when presently,
three years after the death of his wife, he disappeared,
it was found that he had lost his house also and all his
possessions.</p>

<p>When news of his death in a railway wreck near
Chicago came to Mr. Langley, who had meanwhile
sheltered Reuben, he made enquiries and found that
the cottage had been mortgaged to its full value. The
bank at Wenham which held the mortgage offered the
cottage for sale, then, when no purchaser appeared,
for rent. Soon after, an elderly couple whose married
daughter lived in the South Hollow took it and
occupied it for six years until early in the preceding
summer when their daughter had been widowed and
they had gone to live with her. The cottage stood idle
all summer but early in September a new family
moved in, a mother and daughter, the first strangers
to come to the village for years. No one knew whence
they came nor who they were. They moved in so
quietly that scarcely anyone knew the house was occupied
until they saw smoke coming from the squat,
picturesque chimney.</p>

<p>No one had seen the mother; but the daughter,
who had answered the door or gone out on errands,
was said to be as handsome as she was haughty. They
responded to no friendly overtures, refusing entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
even to Mr. Langley, and seemed to feel themselves
superior to the place and the people and to the cottage
where they lived which was, indeed, a simple dwelling
when compared with the simplest summer homes of
the wealthy. For they were said to have been enormously
wealthy and suddenly to have found themselves
penniless at the death of the husband and father
who had gambled or speculated until he had come to
his last farthing. It was understood that they were
relatives or connections of the president of the bank
at Wenham, who had offered them the shelter of the
cottage in the lane.</p>

<p>Anna Miller attributed their desire for seclusion to
grief over the death of the husband and father rather
than to pride. She couldn’t help fearing what had
evidently occurred to none other that he might have
died by his own hand, and she felt that such a shock
might well leave them too sore and sick at heart to
wish to see any human being. Nevertheless she said
to herself, with an assurance that was made up of
humility and warm-heartedness as well as of vanity,
that she would somehow effect an entrance where
others failed.</p>

<p>When she ran straight into the strange girl’s arms
on the day she was fleeing from the parsonage and
the spectre she had elicited, the one shock counteracted
the other. Controlling her hysterical shuddering, she
murmured an earnest apology.</p>

<p>“Dear me! I might have knocked you down, butting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
into you that way. You are sure I didn’t hurt
you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” the girl repeated quietly, and Anna
liked her voice as much as her dark, pretty face. “But
what was it?” she asked. “Was someone or something
chasing you?”</p>

<p>Anna smiled rather wanly as she moved back to
get the support of the stone wall which fenced the
lane. “Not exactly, unless it was a ghost,” she said
in her usual droll way. “Sit down here, won’t you,
and I’ll tell you about it.”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t stop,” the girl said nervously. “I only
thought—you needed help.”</p>

<p>“So I do, the worst way. Honest, I’m like a rag.
My knees shake and——”</p>

<p>The stranger sat down on the wall beside her and
put her arm about her shelteringly. Anna leaned
against her gratefully and closed her eyes for a few
moments. The older girl gazed at her wonderingly.
An hungry, almost a starved look came into the dark
eyes and the arm which supported Anna clasped her
almost fiercely.</p>

<p>Anna opened her eyes and smiled without moving.</p>

<p>“You’ll think I’m a perfect baby,” she declared, “but
truly I have had a queer sort of shock.”</p>

<p>She sat erect and slipped down, then seated herself
again. “I’m too wobbly to walk just yet. I’ll wait a
bit until I feel better or see a waggon. I wish you
felt like waiting with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>The other girl’s brow puckered in a slight frown.
Anna introduced herself.</p>

<p>“I am Anna Miller. I have wanted awfully to get
acquainted with you, though truly I didn’t mean to
break in the way I did.”</p>

<p>The dark girl smiled vaguely and rose slowly from
the wall. Anna sprang up also.</p>

<p>“You mind—waiting alone?” the stranger asked
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid, only I don’t seem to feel like facing
my thoughts at this moment. I guess I’ll hike along
if you’re leaving me.”</p>

<p>As she breathed a deep sigh, the dark girl looked at
her in troubled fashion.</p>

<p>“Come up to our cottage and have a cup of tea
first,” she asked in a constrained manner. Anna said
afterwards to Miss Penny that if she had talked Latin
she would have used the form of interrogation that
expects the answer no.</p>

<p>“I’d like to, first rate, if it wouldn’t be too much
bother for you,” she said frankly. And when the
other assured her that it would be no trouble, she put
her hand on her arm and they went up the lane
together.</p>

<p>The outer door led straight into the living-room.
As they entered, a tall, handsome, dark-eyed woman
with a proud, forbidding countenance rose from a
chair and confronted them.</p>

<p>“Mother, this is Miss Miller,” the girl said deprecatingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
“She doesn’t feel well—she’s faint and I
want to make her a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>“Not Miss Miller,—Anna, please. No one calls me
anything else,” the girl asked in her sweet young voice.
But the woman, who bowed stiffly without extending
her hand, asked Miss Miller stiffly to be seated. Anna
dropped limply into a chair. The other girl went out
of the room.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t catch your name,” murmured Anna.</p>

<p>“Lorraine,” said the woman coldly and yet with a
certain fierce warmth.</p>

<p>“Somehow that name sounds very familiar to me,”
Anna observed, only to perceive by the woman’s face
that she had made an extremely mal àpropos remark.
“I suppose it’s the city—or province in France I am
thinking of,” she added lamely.</p>

<p>“Quite likely,” returned Mrs. Lorraine frigidly,
and taking up a piece of embroidery began sternly
to set fine stitches in it. Anna glanced at her timidly.</p>

<p>“How pretty your fancy-work is,” she remarked,
politely deprecatory. She told Miss Penny afterwards
that she wondered the stuff weren’t all eyelet-holes, for
Mrs. Lorraine’s eyes, black as they were, reminded
her of burning coals. And she declared that hereafter
she would believe in the tamarisk or basilisk or
whatever the bird was whose gaze turned one to stone.</p>

<p>“It could hardly be called fancy-work,” Mrs. Lorraine
rejoined, and her voice was the more cutting in
that it was naturally good and had the modulations
of one who has lived among educated people in society.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
“I make my living and that of my daughter—or try
to—doing this work.”</p>

<p>Anna felt she should have run from this house also
had not the daughter appeared at this moment with a
tray containing a cup of tea and a plate of biscuit.
She took it gratefully and in her nervousness scalded
her throat so that tears came to her eyes. It would
have been easy to burst into tears, and the girl resolutely
studied the pattern of the napkin. So doing,
she noticed that it was of the finest damask she had
ever seen but was apparently old for it was darned
and patched. Somehow, she had never heard of
patching napkins. But she felt Mrs. Lorraine’s piercing
eyes upon her and transferred her attention to the
silver spoon which was also old, very thin and exceedingly
fine.</p>

<p>“They were my grandmother’s, and I kept the dozen.
They were too thin and worn to be worth anything,”
Mrs. Lorraine declared in the manner of challenge.
And Anna felt that she could endure no longer.
Gulping down the tea, she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“I must be going,” she said and turning to the
daughter thanked her for the refreshment.</p>

<p>“I feel so much better,” she said. “I——”</p>

<p>Pausing, she gazed wistfully at the girl who seemed
sweeter and gentler in contrast with her mother’s
haughtiness, and to whom Anna’s heart went out
warmly. It seemed as if she couldn’t leave her without
pledge of another meeting. But when she asked
if she might call for her on the morrow to go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
church, Mrs. Lorraine said that she and her daughter
did not go out.</p>

<p>“Just the same, I am sure there were tears in that
sweet girl’s eyes,” Anna told Miss Penny that evening.
“She is all ready to be friendly, but what can she do
with that terrible old woman. And yet—I’m sorry
for her, too, poor thing!”</p>

<p>“I suppose she doesn’t like to appear out after being
so rich, though they must have some of their fine
clothes left,” returned Miss Penny. “But it may be
their carriage, you know, though for that matter I
don’t know why even people with a coachman and
footmen should care to drive to church when it’s only
across the way—that is, it’s cross-wise from the parsonage
and there’s only one house between the parsonage
and the lane, and Reuben’s father didn’t have
to start until the last minute, though he was always
there, of course, to begin to play before the opening
of service. And there’s no barn for the carriage and
where would they put the coachman?”</p>

<p>“They could make a nice little coop for him by
putting hinges on the floor of the pipe organ platform
and making a lid of it,” remarked Anna lightly. She
had decided on the way home that she would not
mention her visit to the parsonage to anyone. She
would fulfill her promise, clean the little marble lamb
and then forget all about it and about Mrs. Langley
and go back to thinking of Mr. Langley as if he were
a bachelor. She would make no further ill-advised
efforts to bring back his youthfulness; she would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
thankful if she hadn’t added ten years to his age. If
he didn’t appear to-morrow in the pulpit with snow-white
hair she would thank her lucky stars and never
meddle with his affairs again.</p>

<p>“I forgot there’s a shop on the place,—it went with
the old house that was torn down,” Miss Penny remarked
and went on to try to fit the coachman and at
least one footman in there, though she could not recollect
whether there was a second story or loft or not.
And Anna listened absently and thought of Mrs.
Langley.</p>

<p>Fortunately the third Saturday was also fair. Anna
set out early with a basket that might have been intended
for autumn wild flowers but really contained
cloths, a cake of sand soap, a bottle of ammonia and
a tiny vial containing acid. As she followed the winding
foot-path leading up the hill, and all the while she
was working on the stone with patient skilful fingers,
she seemed to hear over and over in her mind, she
seemed to scrub to the rhythm of the warning <i>Let
sleeping dogs lie, Let sleeping dogs lie</i>. Mr. Langley
wouldn’t have thanked her for arousing that old
woman to life,—but fortunately she <i>hadn’t</i> done any
such thing. It was only temporary—a flare-up of interest
that would die down as soon as she should be
satisfied concerning the stone. She would report her
success—for she was succeeding—on her way home
and would thereafter leave her in the condition in
which she had found her and wherein she seemed
perfectly content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>When she had done, the little image was so white
and sweet and appealing that Anna was loth to leave
it. And when she bent to kiss the meek little head in
long farewell she couldn’t help thinking pityingly of
Mrs. Langley. Poor thing! Poor forlorn creature!
If only someone had gotten at her earlier before she
had become a petrified mummy! It was too late now,
but Anna wished with all her heart she could see the
little lamb in its new freshness. She was sorry for
her, more than sorry. Nevertheless as she descended
the hill the girl simply could not face the thought of
that darkened, musty room with the wild eyes glaring
through the dimness. She decided to write a note and
took a bypath which avoided the parsonage.</p>

<p>That night she wrote a note which her brother
Frank delivered after Sunday school next day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Langley</span>, the little lamb is white as
snow again, a perfect darling,—<i>fleckless</i> as the books
would say. I had to kiss its little head when I had
finished, it was such a cutey. As I ought really to be
studying up to my ears to keep up with the little cash-girls
of the ABC class, I will send this note by my
brother instead of disturbing you. I will keep my eye
on the image from this time on.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours faithfully,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Anna</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>As she finished the letter, Mrs. Phelps came in.
Anna knew by her face that she had some exciting or
shocking bit of news to relate, and her heart sank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Quite likely the report of her visit to the parsonage
was all over the place!</p>

<p>“Have you heard about the Lorraines?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The Lorraines?” repeated Anna.</p>

<p>“Yes, Anna. Do you happen to know where Mr.
Lorraine is?” Mrs. Phelps asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“In heaven I trust,” Anna murmured with charitable
intent.</p>

<p>“Not at all and never will be unless he mends his
ways. He’s behind the bars. He is serving a sentence
of ten years in prison for embezzlement!” cried
Mrs. Phelps almost triumphantly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“O&#8202; ANNA,” cried her mother as soon as the girl
had seated herself, “have you heard about the
people who have moved in where the Converses moved
out?”</p>

<p>“Why, Jenny, that’s the house where Reuben was
born and brought up,” observed Seth Miller. “It was
before we knew Reuben or had any suspicion there
was such a person, and we get in the way of thinking
he always lived at Miss Penny’s; but I mistrust he
had a good home and indulgent parents until his ma
died, and his pa, who was one of them musical geniuses,
took to drink.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma, I heard about the Lorraines. Mrs. Phelps
told Miss Penny last night,” returned Anna who
always spent Sunday afternoon at her own home,
which was diagonally across the way from Miss
Penny’s. The girl was pale to-day and leaned listlessly
back in her chair in a way that was foreign to
her wonted lively self. Her mother had noticed in
church that Anna, who was always thin, had grown
intensely so within the last fortnight and had hastened
to get the dinner dishes out of the way before her
daughter should rush in and take the task off her
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“It was all in the papers last spring,” said Miller.
“They was chock full of it for a spell, and the queer
part of it was that the denouncement of the hull thing
came right at the same time Wat Graham was arrested
over at Wenham. If it hadn’t ’a been for Wat’s
brother-in-law, Mudge, going bail for him and helping
settle with the creditors, why Wat himself might
’a been in the cell next to Mr. Lorraine.”</p>

<p>“Why, Pa Miller! Wat Graham’s in another class
altogether,” protested Anna.</p>

<p>“I know they called Lorraine an embezzler, but I
supposed that was only a polite name for thief,” her
father rejoined. “Anyhow, it looked from the papers
and from what was said over to Spicer’s last night as
if he was a particularly mean kind of thief—sort of
specialized on widders and orphans, you might say.”</p>

<p>Anna uttered a little cry of protest. Mrs. Phelps
had said that the story was that Lorraine’s crookedness
had involved thousands of small investors who
had lost their all through him. She had added that
more than one of those ruined thus had committed
suicide. As Anna had lain awake thinking of it, she
had tried to convince herself that the latter statement
was false, and the rest exaggerated. She hadn’t succeeded,
but it was not until now that she realized
that she had utterly failed. Poor Miss Lorraine! And
no wonder Mrs. Lorraine protected herself with the
bristles and spikes of a porcupine!</p>

<p>“Reuben will most likely feel cut up to have such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
people living in his old house,” Mrs. Miller opined
sadly.</p>

<p>“O ma, they can’t help it, and they aren’t that sort
themselves at all!” cried Anna.</p>

<p>“And my patience, Jenny, Reuben would be the
last one in the world to object to anybody because they
was down; the quickest way to reach Reuben’s heart
is to be in trouble,” declared Seth Miller loyally. “He
started out as a little shaver by rescuing a poor, forlorn
tramp cat, and he’s been like a shepherd seeking
for lost sheep ever since. By the by, Anna, did I
ever tell you that story—how Reuben clumb the
highest tree in the county and like as not in the state?”</p>

<p>“You certainly did, pa, the very day after I got
back, and many’s the time you have offered to tell it
to me again,” retorted the girl. “Miss Penny told me
the same story the second time she laid eyes on me
and this very week she refreshed my memory with all
the fine points of it. But all the same, it’s a first rate
yarn, and Reuben’s a brick.”</p>

<p>“That was the beginning of his going to Miss
Penny’s,” Seth Miller went on as if he could not leave
the fascinating subject. Then suddenly he opened his
eyes wide to see Mr. Langley drive up to the gate.</p>

<p>As Mr. Langley stepped on the porch, Anna was
seized with a sudden and almost unaccountable sense
of guilt. She felt as if she must make her escape.
But there was no stairway except that in the front
passage, and here was her mother beamingly ushering
the minister in upon her. But as she glanced up—even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> 
indeed, as she heard his step, the girl was reassured.
Somehow, it seemed as if Mr. Langley had
recaptured his springiness. He looked his old young
self again, and as he took her hand he smiled in a
way that made her feel as if she had had a benediction
all to herself.</p>

<p>“O Anna, my dear child, Mrs. Langley wishes very
much to see you,” he said eagerly and with a certain
largeness that would have been amusing if it hadn’t
been pathetic. For it seemed to indicate that he was
the bearer of a mandate from royalty.</p>

<p>“She expected you yesterday, it seems, and to-day
she was so disappointed to get a note instead of a call
that I volunteered to come up at once and fetch you.”</p>

<p>Thus far no one outside the parsonage had known
of that audacious visit of Anna’s. Seth Miller’s face
wore an expression half-jaunty, half proud. No man
had such extraordinary daughters as he, and sometimes
it seemed as if Anna were quite as remarkable
as Rusty. But Mrs. Miller looked frightened.</p>

<p>Mr. Langley turned to her with his charming smile.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Mrs. Miller! This is the first
time that Mrs. Langley has felt any interest whatever
in anyone or anything since we lost our little Ella
May,” he said in a sort of hushed wonderment. “You
will spare Anna for a little while, won’t you? I’ll
bring her back shortly safe and sound.”</p>

<p>When Anna returned to Miss Penny’s at tea time,
she found her in a state of almost wild excitement.</p>

<p>“O Anna, do sit down and tell me all about it,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
cried. “For the first time in my life I was glad—no,
I can’t say I was glad, but I wasn’t really disappointed
that Mr. Langley didn’t come in. Not that he thinks
it wrong, being Sunday, and anyhow I really am an
old lady and won’t be getting out to service many
years more. But he had the Smith’s horse, you know.
It was nice of him to bring you home, but of course
he would. He thought you were here—that was why
he stopped. And to think of Mrs. Langley’s asking
for you all of her own accord. Dear me, dear me,
what does she look like and did you have a nice time?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly what you would call slick,” replied
Anna in her droll way that cloaked her weariness even
for herself. “There was nothing lively enough about
it to break the Sabbath. Our conversation was confined
to the subject of tombstones.”</p>

<p>“O Anna, my dear!” said Miss Penny in mild
reproof as if it were sacrilegious to speak lightly of
such things.</p>

<p>Anna related briefly the occasion of her first visit
and described the restoration of the marble image in
the cemetery.</p>

<p>“Bless its little heart!” cried Miss Penny who was
as enthusiastic as Anna in her love of animals. “It
must be sweet. I wonder I never thought of going to
look at it on Memorial day. I used to go to the cemetery
regularly every year until I got so lame.”</p>

<p>“We’ll drive the pony up there some day. It’s not
far to walk from the gate,” Anna said.</p>

<p>She dropped into a rocking chair, let her yellow head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
fall wearily back against the cushion and closed her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I had to tell her of it over and over and over,”
she said presently, raising her lashes pensively.</p>

<p>“Anna, you are very tired!” cried Miss Penny.</p>

<p>“Only a wee bit and it isn’t exactly <i>tired</i>, then,”
declared the girl. “But you know how it is when you
go into a painty room or pass by that awful-smelling
tannery place beyond Wenham? You don’t draw a
long breath all the while and yet you don’t realise
that you’re holding your breath. Well, there’s something
about Mrs. Langley and her room that makes
you feel as if you were sitting on the edge of your
chair waiting until you can get out where you see
sunshine and people that talk and smile. Her eyes,
you know, like coals of fire in the Bible, and great
hollows in her cheeks and a voice that seems to come
from a cave or a tomb. The blinds are drawn down
almost to the window sills and there are medicine
bottles to burn. There’s air enough, I suppose, but
not the kind that’s sweetened by sunshine. It seems
musty and makes you feel as if there were spiders in
all the dark corners—huge black spiders with bodies
big as this and crooked legs!”</p>

<p>“O Anna!”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! And what do you think? She wants
me to come to see her every Saturday,—every blooming
Saturday afternoon, Miss Penny.”</p>

<p>“Anna dear, I wouldn’t do it. You really must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
not,” said Miss Penny gravely. “It would be too great
a strain upon you.”</p>

<p>Anna threw herself on the hassock at Miss Penny’s
feet leaning her head upon the knee that was not lame.</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Penny, I am glad to go again and
every Saturday,” she said softly. “Mr. Langley almost
had tears in his eyes when he spoke of it. I didn’t
dare look at him again to make sure, because after I
had come out of that creepy place it wouldn’t have
taken much to set me to crying.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” murmured Miss Penny stroking
the girl’s yellow hair. “And to tell the truth, Anna,
I almost envy you in being able to do something for
Mr. Langley. Ever since he came to be our preacher,
I have longed to do something for him to express my
appreciation and affection for him, but it always seems
impossible. It has always been the other way—his
doing for me. And the best things in my life have
come to me through him, Reuben and Rusty and now
you, Anna.”</p>

<p>“Miss Penny,” said Anna quickly, “you know he
visits her every day. Do you suppose he kisses her?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, Anna! what a question! I’m sure I
have no idea. I suppose he does.”</p>

<p>“But how can he! But you haven’t seen her as
she is now, and you never could imagine how she
looks. He certainly seems to think a heap of her all
the same, and as he can see as well as I can in the
dark, he can’t help seeing that she looks old enough to
be his great aunt. Well, I’m sorry for her but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
wouldn’t be related to her for a gold mine. However,
I can stand it once a week all right.”</p>

<p>In the following days, they recurred to the matter
frequently. A dozen times, Miss Penny suggested suddenly
a new topic of conversation that had popped into
her head as appropriate for Anna to introduce as an
alternative to that of tombstones; but each one being
only more utterly absurd than the foregoing, Anna
would laugh until she cried, Miss Penny joining her
merrily. None the less, when she returned late Saturday
afternoon, she announced that she had gotten
away from the little lamb, though not perhaps very far.</p>

<p>The girl had proposed one subject after another,
receiving no response. And it had presently been
borne in upon her there could hardly be a response in
the nature of the case. Mrs. Langley was really living,
so far as she was alive at all, in another generation,
so that trying to converse with her was like shouting
to someone miles behind one on the highway and only
visible because of curves in the course of it. The
years she had lived in retirement had counted for little
more than nothing. Her mind was twenty years
younger than the village she dwelt in.</p>

<p>“When I realised that, I tried to get back, and after
a bit she was glad to talk about Ella May,” Anna said
to Miss Penny as she dried the china after tea. “Only
you would hardly know it <i>was</i> Ella May. Mr. Langley’s
Ella May has been growing all these years until
she went to college with Rusty and jumped ahead and
graduated and—O dear me! Hers is still a teeny baby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
three days old. Now, Miss Penny, when those two
get to heaven one of them is going to have the surprise
of their lives.”</p>

<p>“Why Anna,” murmured Miss Penny reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Meantime, things are at sixes and sevens with both
of them. What she needs is another baby, and what
he needs is a full grown wife. Both of ’em need it
frightfully. But how in the world is it ever going to
be brought about, and who is to do it? I may think I
am Charley-on-the-spot for ordinary cases, but a
sticker like this stumps me flat. It would take someone
a heap smarter than me to haul her over all the
years she has missed and bring her up to date. And
while that’s being done to her mind, her face, her
looks ought to be stretched the other way until she
looks somewhere near as young as her husband.”</p>

<p>The girl sighed. “It’s like the North-west Passage.
It ought to be done, and I suppose it could
be, but not by yours truly. And the worst is, she
refuses to see anybody else. She hardly pays any
more attention to Mr. Langley than she did before—just
sends him orders about me through Big Bell.
O Miss Penny, did you ever hear the proverb ‘Let
sleeping dogs lie’?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANTIME the other Miller girl had made a
second call at the house in the lane which Reuben’s
father had built. When her rat-a-tat at the door
sounded drearily as from an empty house, the girl said
to herself that it was too much. Most likely the
ogress had slain her lovely daughter and then fallen
dead herself and their corpses lay stretched upon the
organ platform in the room which would never be a
living-room thereafter. But the lovely daughter
came to the door. The cold, haughty expression on
her face changed to eagerness as she saw Anna and
she smiled sweetly and rather touchingly.</p>

<p>“O Miss Miller, I am so glad—to see you,” she
said. But with the last words enthusiasm had become
dismay. She paled and looked appealingly at Anna.</p>

<p>“Don’t call me Miss Miller, please. Nobody does.
And—may I come in?” asked Anna.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry, Miss—Anna, but mother—we don’t
have company, you know.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not company. And anyhow, I’ve got to
come in this once for I’ve got something for you,”
Anna declared.</p>

<p>As the proud look returned to the older girl’s face
and she started to say something in regard to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
mother, Anna drew forth from the covert of her
jacket a tiny ball of a maltese kitten with a white
parting between its baby blue eyes, a line of white
waistcoat, and four white paws, two of which had
extra toes. Nothing could have been rounder or
silkier or more altogether appealing than this baby
kitten with its round, innocent eyes and its bit of
pink tongue visible, and as Anna held it out, the
other girl took it ecstatically and held it close to her
face. Then she cried out impulsively to her mother
and ran with it to her. Anna followed her in, closing
the door behind her.</p>

<p>Anna’s purpose had been deliberate. Still, it was
almost unbelievable to see Mrs. Lorraine’s grimness
melt before that absurd mite of kitten. As her
daughter passed it over to her, she, too, hid her face
against its softness. Then she put it in her lap and
gazed at it in a sort of fascination, her daughter hanging
over her and quite unnecessarily calling attention
to the little thing’s charms. As a matter of fact, Mrs.
Lorraine hadn’t handled—hadn’t even seen—a baby
kitten of the ordinary, harmless, necessary cat-kind
since she had been a child in a New England farmhouse
and had worshipped the successive litters of a
three-coloured Tabby that had lived at one of the
barns. They had left the farm for the city before she
was twelve; but though she had had pets in the elegant
home her parents had fallen heirs to and in the
magnificent residences of the millionaire she had
married, they had been the expensive, pedigreed sophisticated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
pets of the rich and hadn’t appealed to her
as Tabby and her kittens and the mongrel shepherd
dog of the farm had done. And not even the latter
had so appealed to her as this tiny plebeian offspring
of a too prolific Tabby mother who kept the tender-hearted
Anna busy in finding homes for her numerous
kittens. Her sore heart could reach out to its
innocence without injury to her wounded pride.</p>

<p>“It is a love, isn’t it?” remarked Anna presently,
partly to call attention to herself and partly because
she couldn’t help it. For she was herself ‘crazy over’
the kitten, as she put it. And joining the little group,
she pointed out its double paws and the white tip of
its tail which were the only details the daughter hadn’t
exclaimed over.</p>

<p>“I started out right after school to find a home for
it. There were three of them but the grocer at the
Hollow took the yellow twins—I suppose he’ll call
’em the Gold-Dust Twins. It looks as if I needn’t go
further. Are you willing to take him in, Mrs. Lorraine?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we ought to,” returned Mrs.
Lorraine, trying to speak stiffly. But somehow, even
the thought that perhaps it would be wrong for the
family of a criminal to indulge themselves even so
little was ineffectual to stiffen her with that soft little
ball in her lap.</p>

<p>“Mother!” cried the girl beseechingly.</p>

<p>“You will need a cat, you know. Every household
does,” said Anna sagely. “This one will make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
fine one, too. All of Tabby’s kittens do. Never a one
has failed to give satisfaction in the households in
which I have placed them. Ma’s never had any mice
in our house since I brought the mother-cat home. I
found her on a lonely road a mile or more from any
house. Just think, someone had abandoned her. It
must have been someone in Wenham that came over
to drop poor Tabby, for before there wasn’t a three-coloured
cat in all Farleigh.”</p>

<p>“We had a tortoise-shell cat on the farm when I
was a little girl,” remarked Mrs. Lorraine quietly with
a gentler look in her eyes than Anna would have believed
possible. “Alice, perhaps the kitten would like
some milk,” she added.</p>

<p>Alice fetched a saucer and put it on the hearth.
Mrs. Lorraine placed the kitten beside it as gently as
if it had been a fragile egg shell and the three hung
over it eagerly. The kitten put his nose in so far that
he spluttered amusingly and once he dipped a paw in;
but it was too light to overturn the dish and he drank
enough to prove himself of sufficient age to be taken
from his mother.</p>

<p>“Now he’d like a nap,” remarked Anna, picking him
up. She wanted to give him to Alice (sweet name,
Alice Lorraine!) who hadn’t had a chance at him at
all; but she put him into Mrs. Lorraine’s lap and he
curled into a yet rounder ball and was asleep at once.</p>

<p>“Speaking of tramp cats,” Anna remarked, though
as a matter of fact the subject hadn’t come up, “you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
probably know that Reuben Cartright once lived in
this house?”</p>

<p>“Reuben Cartright—is he a musician?” asked Mrs.
Lorraine.</p>

<p>“Dear me, no. His father was a musician, though
he wasn’t noted. He was organist at the church for
a long time. He built this house, though not with his
own hands. Did you ever wonder what that platform
was for?”</p>

<p>“I thought this was a very old house and that perhaps
that was a trundle bed,” said Alice. Anna
laughed and Mrs. Lorraine had to smile.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cartright had the floor raised so that when
he got rich he could have a pipe organ put in,” Anna
explained. “I believe the clothes-press in the chamber
above is right over the platform and the same
size and they say he planned to tear out the floor of
that so that the space would go way up to the roof.
But it never came to that. His wife died and he took
to booze and that was the last of him as well as of
the pipe organ.”</p>

<p>“Is the son musical?” asked Mrs. Lorraine, speaking
softly as if the sleeping kitten were a baby.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, in a way, though he’s never had much
chance. He has beautiful hands, slim with long
fingers, and his father gave him lessons up to the
time Reuben was nine and his mother died. Since
then Reuben has never had time for music. He has
worked his own way, and besides—as pa says, ever
since he rescued that tramp cat from the pine tree in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the common at the Hollow, he’s been on the look out
for that sort of extra jobs. It’s a sort of private
joke between me and myself, the story of that rescue
is, though I shouldn’t dare let Miss Penny know it,
or pa or Rusty, my sister. I was away from home
five years—ran away to seek my fortune and never
caught up to it—and this happened in my absence.
Pa told me the story the day after I got home and
then Miss Penny. Ma told me, too, and no end of
other people offered to. And to this day, pa or Miss
Penny will ask me whether I happened to hear this or
that particular and even if I say yes are likely to go
on as if they suspected I didn’t get it straight or
whole. But I will say it’s a good story and will bear
repeating.”</p>

<p>“O Anna, won’t you please tell it to us!” cried
Alice, and her mother looked acquiescent and perhaps
eager.</p>

<p>Anna complied. The tale had, indeed, been told
many a time before in Farleigh to the end of the
Hollow; but though no narrator had ever before employed
such a jargon of slang as the other Miller girl
used, perhaps none had ever told it better nor more
sympathetically. The telling of it amused and interested
Alice Lorraine, who was already more drawn
towards Anna Miller than she had been to any girl
she had known before, but it affected her mother more
powerfully. Henrietta Lorraine (‘Hetty’ was the
little girl of the farm) had been for years a cold,
proud woman, a slave, unconsciously, to her husband’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
vast possessions. During the past six months,
following the disgrace of her husband and his commitment
to prison, her pride had become a sort of
fierce arrogance, while her sense of injury, her bitterness
towards all the world had shut her within bars
hard as iron. But now as she sat quiet, the tension of
months relaxed, with the kitten in her arms, and listened
to the tale the odd, droll, charmingly pretty,
appealing young girl rattled off so flippantly, something
began to melt within her. Nor was it merely
the icy crust that had protected her crushed feelings
of late. As the kindly folk of the story rose compellingly
before her, called forth by the wand of humourous
sympathy of the yellow-haired fairy, and
she saw not only Reuben Cartwright and the forlorn
cat, but Miss Penny and Mr. Langley, the fat pony
and the fat janitor who later was nearly to burn the
grammar school building to the ground,—as she saw
all this and more, the woman she had been for years
was so moved that she felt almost like the woman she
might and should have been. Alice got only the story
Anna told. Her mother, who had been a country
child herself and whose natural sympathy was with
country folk and ways, got a broader view and a
deeper vision. She felt something genuine and fine
and sincere and worth while in this bit of village
life,—something that was attainable to others. And
it came to her that possibly Alice’s life and even her
own weren’t irretrievably ruined and wrecked. In any
event, terrible as had been the storm which had overwhelmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
them, in the restful atmosphere of this place
to which they had been forced to crawl for refuge,
they could at least draw long breaths of relief, and
Alice might later find more than refuge and relief.</p>

<p>At the end of the story, Anna rose hastily. “I
must hike or Miss Penny will be limping round to
get tea,” she said. “Poor dear! She doesn’t drive the
fat pony herself now-a-days and can’t get out of the
phaeton alone for she has rheumatism; but she is as
crazy about kittens as I am and will be as pleased to
hear that this mite has a home.”</p>

<p>Holding out her hand a bit timidly, the girl was
surprised to have Mrs. Lorraine press it warmly.</p>

<p>“We are very grateful to you, Anna Miller, not
only for the kitten but for other things, for changing
the current of our thoughts,” she said.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, Alice Lorraine appeared at
church with Miss Penny and Anna. Her suit was
not new but it was more elegant than anything worn
in Farleigh. Alice was extremely pretty and had the
look of one who has, so to speak, always lain on rose
leaves, and Anna felt proud to walk up the aisle with
such a distinguished-looking girl. Miss Penny begged
her to go home with them after service but Alice
wouldn’t leave her mother. She walked down to the
Hollow the next afternoon, however.</p>

<p>She couldn’t stay for tea, but Anna gave her a piece
of cake and a cup of chocolate. As Anna walked
part way home with her, she spoke of the cake.</p>

<p>“I wish I could cook,” she said. “I know nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
whatever about it, and mother knows only what she
learned before she was twelve, and cook-books are
such queer things to follow. I don’t mind eating
tinned things, but it’s hard on mother, though she
never says anything. And besides,—O Anna, you
wouldn’t believe it, but I hardly know my mother. At
home after I was through with nurses and governesses,
she went her way and I mine as everyone seems to do
in the city. And now—I care for her more than I
ever dreamed, but I don’t seem to be able to show
it or to take care of her.”</p>

<p>Anna talked it over with Miss Penny that night
and on Saturday morning Alice came over and watched
Anna make bread, cake and cookies. Miss Penny was
in the kitchen the greater part of the time and Alice
took to the odd, inconsecutive, warm-hearted little lady
as warmly as others had always done, so that on a
second Saturday they were like three girls together.
Alice began to frequent the house at all hours. And
Miss Penny, who was one of the best housewives in
the two villages and who had taught Rusty and Anna
and through them their mother, gave the girl the best
of instruction in cooking and all sorts of domestic
matters, besides amusing and entertaining her with
other stories than the tale of Reuben and the tramp
cat which she gravely related to Alice the first time
the two were alone together.</p>

<p>“O Miss Penny, the days fly by as they never did
before and I wake so happy every morning that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
ashamed of myself!” Alice cried one afternoon as
she waited for Anna to come from the academy.</p>

<p>“Ashamed, Alice?”</p>

<p>The girl paled. “Yes, Miss Penny, because of my
father. You know about him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I know. At first I was sorry that people
in the village should know, but now I really think it
best. After all, newcomers are discussed just so
much, and—of course there aren’t many newcomers
now-a-days—not that there ever were many. Anna’s
family were the last to move into Farleigh before you
and your mother. That was when Freddy was a
baby—Freddy, you know isn’t the one who looks
after my pony. That’s Frank. He does very well,
but of course Reuben taught him, and Rusty’s brother—and
of course, Anna’s—couldn’t help doing well.
But I felt as if I ought to sell both the cows. It’s a
pity for Seth Miller with all his work to have to keep
the milking in mind. There’s only the one cow—Mr.
Mudge is keeping the other—and Seth thinks the world
of Reuben and knows Reuben would feel terribly
to have the other cow disposed of—I don’t mean
killed of course, though that is the way they speak
of killing poor cats and kittens. And that reminds
me, Alice. How is yours?”</p>

<p>As Alice would have replied, a peculiar knock
sounded on the door. Alice asked if she should answer
it. But Miss Penny, whose face had lighted up,
said that it was Mr. Langley, and that he would let
himself in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“He raps in a peculiar way—it’s really a bar of
music. He and Reuben’s father always used it. He—O
Mr. Langley, how good you are!”</p>

<p>“Good to myself, yes indeed. I am really self-indulgent
when I come in here, Miss Penny.”</p>

<p>“I appeal to you, Miss Lorraine,” he said as he
shook hands with the girl. “Do you consider it an
act of goodness or the gratification of a desire for
refreshment to come to see Miss Penny?”</p>

<p>“It’s a case of receiving wholly on my part,”
asserted Alice with a shy smile for Miss Penny.</p>

<p>“I interrupted a conversation. Pray go on with
it and allow me to listen,” he begged.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Mr. Langley, I am ashamed to say that
for the moment I can’t recollect what we were discussing,”
said Miss Penny in dismay.</p>

<p>Alice smiled, but wanly. “I was telling Miss Penny
that I am really too happy, Mr. Langley,” she said.
“I am happier than I have ever been before. As far
back as I can remember, the days were always long,
I got tired of everything and was bored the greater
part of the time. I cared for nothing but my music,
and I never enjoyed that as I do going about with
Anna and listening to Miss Penny and learning to
make bread and doughnuts. And—there’s poor
mother at home thinking of—my father. And I-I
have to <i>make</i> myself think of him.”</p>

<p>“But my dear Miss Lorraine, you are doing this
in large part for your mother. You are sitting at
the feet of Miss Penny in order to learn how to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
one of the most attractive cottages ever built into a
real home for her. And while you are broadening
your life with these new influences which seem more
congenial than those you have known before, no
doubt you are enriching your mother’s life as well?
You tell her of all that takes place, I dare say?”</p>

<p>“Everything. And she is interested and forgets—for
a little. And Anna goes in and—mother loves
Anna already.”</p>

<p>He turned smilingly to Miss Penny. “Anna is
more like you, Miss Penny, after all, than any other
of your foster children,” he said and then went on
talking to Alice.</p>

<p>As he rose to take leave, he told Alice he hoped
her mother might meet Miss Penny before long. At
the door, he kept her a minute.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel guilty when you forget your father
and don’t force yourself to think of him, Miss Lorraine,”
he said earnestly. “Open your whole heart to
the new life and help your mother in her much harder
task of reconciling herself to a new future. Write
your father, and if he gets the impression he should
from your letters, he will conclude that your life isn’t
going to be spoiled and—why, that will surely make a
great difference to him.”</p>

<p>There was a blur before the girl’s eyes so that she
couldn’t see the minister’s figure at the gate. Instead
of returning to the sitting-room she stole upstairs
for a few minutes of silence in Anna’s large, pretty
chamber where she was always free to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Entering the room, she started at sight of a figure
on the bed. As she saw that it was Anna and that
her face was buried in the pillow, her heart grew cold.
What had happened. Or hadn’t anything happened?
Was it that, all the while the girl was devoted to
other interests than her own, some secret sorrow was
eating at her heart?</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EARLY the following afternoon Anna Miller made
her way to the parsonage.</p>

<p>She announced the fact immediately that she couldn’t
stay long to-day. For already the clever girl had, as
she put it, ‘sized up’ the lady of the parsonage and
knew better than to wait until later and then ‘spring’
the unwelcome fact upon her.</p>

<p>“O Anna, with all the long week, counting Sunday,
and with a long forenoon on Saturday, it seems as
if you might spare me Saturday afternoon,” protested
the invalid.</p>

<p>“I can usually, Mrs. Langley, but you see I am
going away Monday morning early and there’s my
packing and ever so many things to attend to besides
going over home, as I always do on Saturday, to see
if ma’s clothes and pa’s ties and shirts and the boys’
are in Sunday-go-to-meeting shape,” Anna explained.</p>

<p>She waited for Mrs. Langley to ask where she was
going or to evince some interest in her journey. Not
that she was the sort of person to crave such attention.
But the more she saw of Mrs. Langley, the
more she realized how self-centered her life had made
her. In a certain sense, it wasn’t her fault. But for
the sake of Mr. Langley, his wife must somehow be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
induced to think of other folk or other concerns than
herself, her dead baby, and the baby’s tombstone. And
in that the only person she really had anything to do
with was Anna it would have been encouraging to
have her show some faint interest in her comings
and goings when they did not lead to the parsonage,
or the cemetery on yonder hillside.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Langley’s only concern was for her precious
Saturday.</p>

<p>“But you will surely be back before the end of the
week, Anna?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall,” said Anna soberly. “But I may
not be able to come here for a fortnight. I shall
have a lot of studying to do to make up my work at
school.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t Mr. Langley on the school committee?” demanded
his wife.</p>

<p>Wondering at her acquaintance with even so little
of current history, Anna told her that he was chairman.</p>

<p>“Very well. Then he can arrange so that you
needn’t make up the time and you can come here just
the same.”</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Langley, I don’t think he could or would
do that, and anyhow I wouldn’t have him,” Anna protested.
“For after all, I’m really crazy about school.
I believe I like it all the better for knowing the world
a bit. As a matter of fact, you know, I could give
Mr. Phillips points. And I couldn’t <i>not</i> make up
certain things. For example, there’s the Peloponnesian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
War. The plague began yesterday and,—O dear,
like as not when I get back I shall find the whole
bunch stark dead. And then there are those poor
Helvetians all packed up and ready to hike with their
babies and cattle and pups and duds and all,—and
those blooming Roman soldiers ready to drive ’em
straight back. I’ve simply <i>got</i> to see what happened
to them. They had pluck—and yet, I can’t for the
life of me understand how they had the heart to burn
down their houses and their fields of grain. I dare
say it showed their faith in God, but they might have
wanted to show their grandchildren years afterwards
where they had lived.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember ever hearing about them. Are
they in the Bible, Anna?” Mrs. Langley asked, and
before Anna could answer, bade her tell their tale.</p>

<p>Surprised and delighted, the girl complied. Not at
all a scholar, Anna Miller nevertheless gleaned all
sorts of riches from text books that are desert wastes
to the majority of young folk. And now, relating the
history of the Helvetians so far as she had followed
it, in the graphic account Julius Caesar gives of the
unhappy impulse towards migration of these people
pent up in an inland island, she made it as interesting
as a fairy tale to a child. Mrs. Langley listened spell-bound.
And though Anna was disappointed to have
her hark back to her usual subject, even the momentary
interest in something foreign to it counted for
something.</p>

<p>“It must have been hardest of all for them to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
their graveyards behind them,” she murmured, “for
mothers to leave their babies’ graves.”</p>

<p>“And widows their husbands’,” Anna added. “And
yet, Mrs. Langley, there’s worse than that. Now my
friend that I am going back to the city to see lost
her husband in the summer and now she’s sick herself,
and there’s her baby. If she should—well, it
must be no end harder for one to think of dying and
leaving one’s baby alone in the world than to move
away from somewhere and leave the grave of a baby
whose soul is all safe.”</p>

<p>“Your friend must be older than you, Anna,” Mrs.
Langley observed irrelevantly.</p>

<p>“Two years, but we were the best of friends. She
was at the ribbons with me at Mason and Martin’s
and Joe was at the soda fountain. He was the nicest
boy—and the thinnest! My goodness! Matches
would seem as big as the pillars of the Squire Bennet
place at Wenham compared with his legs. He and
Bessy were married and went to housekeeping in two
rooms and were happy as kings. Joe was sick after
a while and Bessy came back to work beside me. Then
the baby came and Joe went back to work before he
was able. He looked so bum they wouldn’t have him
at the soda fountain but put him in the stock-room
where his poor phiz, that looked for all the world
like an interrogation point, wouldn’t queer the whole
concern. It must have been awfully hard for him
there, but he stuck it out until last August when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
died. And now poor Bessy thinks she’s dying and
wants to see me.”</p>

<p>“I hate to have you go,” said the invalid with some
warmth, and even thought to ask who was going with
her.</p>

<p>“O, I’m going by my lone. I’m good for it. But
I think I will put up my hair so as to look more responsible.”</p>

<p>“O Anna, don’t do that. I wouldn’t have you do
that for the world!” cried Mrs. Langley. “I like it
just as it is. You see it is just the colour my baby’s
would have been and I was in hopes hers would be
curly, too. I should never have braided hers, though.”</p>

<p>Anna forgot that she ought to be on her way home
and pulled her braid over her shoulder and looked at it
admiringly.</p>

<p>“I wish you would undo it and let me see it all
spread out,” Mrs. Langley said almost eagerly. And
Anna was more than ready to gratify her curiosity.</p>

<p>Untying the bow at the end of the long, heavy,
wavy plait, she loosed the strands and spread out the
silky yellow mass until it enveloped her like a golden
mantle. Mrs. Langley leaned towards her, gazing on
the splendour in fascination, reaching out presently to
stroke it with her lean witch’s fingers. And whenever
Anna made a move to gather it in she uttered a
cry of protest. And the vain girl yielded and forgot
everything except to wish that there were a mirror in
the room.</p>

<p>But when the clock struck five, she started, quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
aghast. Seizing her hat and jacket, she said an hasty
farewell and fled, the cloud of her hair all about her.</p>

<p>As she went, people rushed to their windows to see
the girl’s wonderful hair, gazing spell-bound until she
was out of sight. Afterwards, when they got their
breath, some said the other Miller girl had assurance
to flaunt her single charm thus boldly. But no one
so took the matter to heart as the Reverend Russell
Langley, who met her as he returned from a call at the
Hollow.</p>

<p>Anna hadn’t time even to pause, and Mr. Langley
thought she was ashamed to do so. He took it for
granted that the girl had set out from home with this
almost immodest splendour of yellow tresses all about
her simply to display it, and he felt bewildered and
ashamed and grieved. He shook his head sadly. He
had known that Anna was vain—everyone knew it.
But her vanity had always seemed innocent and harmless,
a part of her droll charm. The girl had seemed
too unselfish, too eagerly active in behalf of others,
to have leisure or desire for deliberate advertising of
her own beauty. She was, he had to acknowledge
now, quite different from Rusty. He began to understand
why people referred to her as the other Miller
girl.</p>

<p>Reaching home, he found, after much searching, a
sermon on humility he had preached fifteen years
before. Putting aside the sermon he had ready for
the morrow, he began to revise this. Revision turned
out to mean re-writing practically the whole discourse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and it was midnight before he rose from his desk. The
new sermon was less severe and dogmatic than the
one of the man of thirty which it replaced, but its
tone was wholesome and effective. And though the
preached hoped that Anna Miller would not realise
that her vanity had been the occasion of it, he trusted
that she would nevertheless take the precepts to heart.</p>

<p>As it was, Anna listened gravely, as she almost invariably
did, to every word of the sermon. But she
did not forget to flop her yellow braid over her
shoulder and as the choir rose to sing, and her sweet,
true voice rang out, the girl was not unaware that she
was conspicuous for that as well as for her personal
appearance.</p>

<p>But she had forgotten all that when she went in to
see Mrs. Lorraine that afternoon to thank her for
allowing Alice to make it possible for her to go to her
friend. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Lorraine had been
shocked when Alice came home Friday evening and
told her of the offer she had made to take Anna’s
place at Miss Penny’s while she was away. She
declared that Alice should not do it. The bitterness
which had seemed to disappear had come back, and
Alice had been greatly disturbed. Mrs. Lorraine had
finally yielded grudgingly, but she felt hurt and injured
and there had been a perceptible coolness between
mother and daughter since. They had never
been close together, but of late they had been nearer
to one another than ever before. The more Alice
associated with Anna and Miss Penny, the more yearningly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
her heart went out towards her mother, and
this coldness that was almost estrangement hurt her
keenly.</p>

<p>She was grateful that Anna did not feel any want
of cordiality in her mother. Mrs. Lorraine received
her thanks quietly and when Anna explained the situation
listened intently and questioned her sympathetically.
And she asked, almost impulsively, if Anna
wasn’t tired out.</p>

<p>“It’s just that I seem pulled so many ways at
once, Mrs. Lorraine,” Anna said. “Really, I ought
not to be at Miss Penny’s. With Rusty at college, I
ought to be at home. Ma and pa need a daughter
there the worst way. I get over all I can, but they’re
so glad to see me and so sorry to have me go just
across the street that it breaks my heart. But someone
has to be with Miss Penny. She was goodness
itself to Rusty and to the whole family, and I love
her as if she were my favorite aunt of all and just
love to be with her. And now there’s Mrs. Langley.
She’s queer. Dick’s hatband had nothing on her
when it comes to being odd. And yet I take to her
and would enjoy sort of mothering her if it didn’t
take me away from Miss Penny and my own family.
And then again, there’s Mr. Langley.”</p>

<p>On a sudden, tears filled the girl’s eyes. But she
smiled through them.</p>

<p>“It’s rum to be so popular, isn’t it Alice?” she
asked. “Wouldn’t you think I was Brother Atlas or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Father Time? The fact is, I’m only the other Miller
girl trying to pretend I’m Charley-on-the-spot.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine bent and kissed her. “You are a
dear, absurd, unselfish child!” she cried warmly. “And
if ever there’s anything Alice or I can do to help you
out in any way, you must come straight to us.
Mustn’t she, Alice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” agreed Alice with shining eyes, and
coming to her mother kissed her shyly.</p>

<p>Both girls would have thought that Mrs. Lorraine
had unbent as far as possible. But she was to go yet
further. On the afternoon of the first day Alice spent
with her, Miss Penny had Frank Miller drive her
over to Farleigh with the fat pony. She returned
with Mrs. Lorraine, whom she had persuaded to visit
her as long as Alice stayed. Mrs. Lorraine was as
much surprised as her daughter, but somehow, there
was no resisting Miss Penny.</p>

<p>She expected to spend the greater part of her time
in her chamber, but she did no such thing though
she was left free. The housework was inconsiderable.
Alice, who took to it strangely, loved to help Miss
Penny, who wasn’t willing to relinquish the whole.
But Mrs. Lorraine found herself wishing to be near
the centre of things in the kitchen or living-room and
drifted thither before the first forenoon was over. It
seemed to her that the very thing her sore heart and
worn nerves had craved was to bask in the homely
warmth of this simple, cosy household. For the first
day she sat in an arm chair with Silvertoes, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
been included in the invitation, in her lap. But on
the second, she felt, after another wonderful night, so
much alive that she wished to be active. She said to
Miss Penny that she should like to learn to cook—to
complete an education in domestic matters begun in
her childhood and interrupted by the receipt of a large
inheritance which drove her family off the farm.
Wherefore, at Miss Penny’s suggestion, Alice was
sent off nutting, and the two women had a long, happy
morning together.</p>

<p>An inborn taste for the domestic and a really good
foundation made Mrs. Lorraine a still readier pupil
than her daughter had been. Miss Penny’s surprise
at her skill drew forth a longer account of Mrs. Lorraine’s
early life. Miss Penny spoke of her own
girlhood and other forgotten details came back to her
guest. And when Alice returned at noon of the
second day, she could scarcely credit what she saw
and felt. Her mother and Miss Penny appeared to
be warm friends.</p>

<p>Anna had already taught Alice to love the out-of-doors,
and though it was less pleasant alone, she took
advantage of her opportunity and remained out all
that she could, believing that her mother and Miss
Penny’s friendship would progress the more rapidly
in her absence. Mr. Langley called one day, and Mrs.
Lorraine saw him and liked him. She told her daughter
what he had said of Richard Cartwright, the man
who had built their cottage, and expressed apprehension
that he might find a bare-looking place when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
he should call. Whereupon it came to Alice that she
might do something to make it look more attractive
before they returned to it.</p>

<p>She went over next day. As she sauntered
towards Farleigh, she thought of the man who had
died before he had attained his heart’s desire. She
did not think of him as Reuben’s father except to
wish that everyone wouldn’t dwell so constantly upon
the son as never to drop any hint to gratify her
hungry, rather mournful curiosity concerning the
father.</p>

<p>He and Mr. Langley had been intimate friends, so
that Mr. Langley would be able to tell one all about
him. Alice was pleased to reflect that since her
mother had met and liked Mr. Langley there was no
bar against her becoming more friendly with him.
She wondered how long she must wait before she
should feel free to question him concerning Richard
Cartwright. The girl sighed as it came to her that he,
too, would most likely insist upon talking about
Reuben instead. She would probably hear the famous
tale of the cat in the primeval pine tree again and
other less familiar incidents connected with the model
youth; but surely after he had exhausted the list—and
she would be patience itself—he would be ready
to speak of the older and more interesting Cartwright.</p>

<p>The outline of the cottage was charmingly picturesque.
As Alice turned into the lane to-day it
struck her afresh and more strongly than ever. As a
matter of fact, it was the first time she had approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
it when her heart had not been burdened with the
sense of her mother’s unhappiness. Relieved of that
burden, dimly aware, indeed, of her mother’s very
pleasant preoccupation and quite forgetting her father,
who had always been a stranger to her, Alice saw
with new eyes and sped on with a light step and a
sense of well-being that she had never known before.</p>

<p>The little porch with settees built in invited the
comer to pause to contemplate the outlook. Alice had
never before had leisure to heed or even to feel the
invitation, but to-day she accepted gratefully. Throwing
herself down, she gazed happily out through a
break in the wall of foliage bordering the lane to the
distant hills. But very shortly, content changed to
vague melancholy which became poignant. The lilac
and blue of those lovely folded hills convinced her
that Dick Cartwright had had even that in mind when
he planned this cottage and this porch. And he must
have sat here where she was sitting now on many a
day at sunset and in the early dusk and under the
evening stars thinking of the organ, which must have
seemed to come nearer and nearer, and dreaming out
melodies to play thereon.</p>

<p>The girl clasped her hands. How terribly sad his
fate had been! He had lost everything and died and
been forgotten. Perhaps if he had had the organ to
comfort him, he wouldn’t have felt the death of his
wife so desperately, and wouldn’t have taken to drink
and met his death. If only someone had given it to
him! There were so many people in the world to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
whom the cost of a pipe organ would have meant little
or nothing. Why, once her own father could have
given away any number of them easier than she and her
mother could dispense coppers to-day. She could have
done it herself.</p>

<p>Well, there was nothing to do now except to make
some atonement for the cruel fate that had come upon
Richard Cartwright. It wasn’t her fault, but it might
have been, and the least she could do would be to make
whatever amends might be possible now. Being the
daughter of a convict, she would of course never marry,
and she would devote her life to the memory of this
genius who had died betimes. She would fulfil her duty
to her mother but all her leisure thought and time and
money (she would earn some in a manner to be determined
later) would go towards reviving his memory
and keeping it green. She would build the organ just
as he had planned and then—why not turn the cottage
into a sort of museum—the Richard Cartwright Memorial?
Or perhaps better than a museum, it might
be a kind of musical centre where famous organists
would give concerts in his memory to the people of
the countryside who hadn’t appreciated him in life
and where poor young men might come to practise
and improvise.</p>

<p>Immensely cheered, Alice took the keys from the
pocket of her jacket to enter the cottage and see if
the whole lower floor could be made into one apartment.
But in her eagerness, she put the wrong key
in the lock. The second key, marked <i>Shop</i> opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
a small separate building hidden in the shrubbery in
the rear. There was a shop at Miss Penny’s too, and
she had said every house had had one in her girlhood,
and this one, which did not match the cottage, evidently
belonged to an earlier dwelling. It occurred
suddenly to Alice that she might find something there
belonging to Dick Cartwright, some memorials to be
put behind glass in a cabinet near the organ.</p>

<p>The sun had dropped below the horizon, but the
girl felt she could make an hurried survey before
dusk—indeed, she must. She ran quickly through
the thicket to the door of the shop and succeeded in
turning the key in the rusty lock. She stole softly in,
awe rather than dread hushing her steps.</p>

<p>The first view was disappointing. The place was
piled full of old boxes and crates and stacks of
yellowed newspapers. But in the corner she caught
glimpses of odd chairs and stands and bits of furniture
which might prove of interest if one could ever
get at them. A narrow stairway with ladder-like
ascent told her what a more observant person would
have implied from the window in the gable above the
door—that there was a second storey.</p>

<p>Catching her skirts in her hand, Alice climbed up.
Her spirits rose the moment her head cleared the railing
above. She stepped directly into a little chamber
which had not been converted into a store room
or dumping ground and stood still to gaze about. It
must have been left as it was when Dick Cartwright
went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>There was a long carpenter’s bench with an iron
contrivance fastened at the end on one long side, and
a smaller table opposite containing rusty tins with a
swinging shelf above holding buckets that had once
contained paint. A stand and a rocking chair stood
near the window at the further end and a dark bench
or couch was drawn into the shadow of the rafters.
A secretary with drawers below the writing shelf and
shelves above with glass doors stood near the other
window which looked towards the house. A chair
stood before it—how many years had it stood there?—and
careless of dust, Alice seated herself in it.</p>

<p>The glass doors were open. A few old, mildewed
books stood on the shelves. They might form a
nucleus of the memorial library, but Alice Lorraine
sighed. For the nonce she had forgotten that Dick
Cartwright was dead. Half mechanically she pulled
out one of the little drawers below. A pile of letters
met her view. The uppermost bore a superscription.
Either dusk or faded ink made it very faint, but the
girl read it—Mr. Richard Cartwright, Farleigh. They
seemed to her the saddest words she had ever read.</p>

<p>Forgetting everything else, the girl sat by the desk
while the shadows in the corners increased, encroaching
more and more upon her island of twilight. Then
on a sudden, strange, nameless terror seized upon her.
She felt as she had once or twice felt in the night
upon awaking without apparent cause from sound
sleep. Her hair seemed to rise from her head and
cold drops stood out on her brow and lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>There was someone else in the room! For some
seconds the girl sat motionless, fearing to stir, to
draw breath. Then she turned her head ever so
slightly and cautiously to see how near she was to the
stair. Two steps would bring her thither. She gazed
as in fascination upon the space for some moments,
then slowly, breathlessly turned her head in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Nothing met her gaze and she grew bolder—or at
least less fearful. Turning about in the chair, though
noiselessly, she surveyed the room. There was nothing
to be seen. She peered in every direction. The
corners were dark but not suspiciously so. It seemed
as if there were something odd about the look of the
couch, but she could reach the stairway, rush down
and be out of the door before anyone or anything
could reach her thence. She rose softly to her feet.</p>

<p>For a little she stood still. Then she tiptoed quietly
towards the dark bench or couch beneath the rafters,
peering before her all the while. Suddenly she paused.</p>

<p>Her horror-stricken eyes made out the outlines of a
dark figure on the couch, an human being, a man who
looked to her frightened gaze of giant size. His eyes
were closed. He was asleep—or dead?</p>

<p>Alice Lorraine stood still trying to think. If the
man were asleep, he was a drunken tramp and she
must flee. If he were dead—O, so much more must
she fly! Not for the world would she be alone with
a dead man, a corpse. She must——</p>

<p>On a sudden the figure moved. The man’s eyes
opened wide.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE the man on the old couch realized the
actuality of the situation and sprang to his feet,
his bewildered, incredulous eyes took in perforce the
vision of a tall, graceful young girl with dark bands
of hair wound about her small head and dark brows
and eyes conspicuous in the dusk because of the pallor
of her face. But pale as she was, and weak and faint
and confused, Alice Lorraine’s fear took flight almost
immediately. The first movement of the unknown
man startled only to reassure her. He sprang to his
feet, but only to shrink back into the corner as if to
allow her to fly if she would.</p>

<p>He waited a moment for that before he spoke. In
the inconsiderable interval, Alice, shaken as she was,
saw the man so clearly that she could have given a
fairly accurate description of him if she had never
seen him thereafter. She saw that he was tall, thin
and gaunt, but that his face, worn as it was, was
almost the face of a boy. That must have been because
of his eyes, which were deep set and wide apart,
not large nor dark of colour but at once shy, kind
and appealing. As he started to speak, it came to the
girl that he was the very image of the man upon whom
her thoughts had been dwelling from the moment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
her leaving the Hollow, except that he was thinner,
more worn, older (save for his eyes) and much more
shabby. But gaunt as the man was, he was no ghost.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. I must have frightened you,”
he murmured in a gentle, deprecatory voice which
would have been exactly the right sort of voice for
the dead musician and which would of itself have
reassured Alice had the dusk been so deep as to veil
the kindliness of his countenance.</p>

<p>“I was—startled,” the girl gasped. “I didn’t know—I
never dreamed——”</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t. It was unpardonable in
me,” he declared. “But I believed the house yonder
was unoccupied. There was no one there all yesterday
and no light at night. I could see that there had
been someone living there, but I supposed whoever it
was had gone—<i>vamoused</i> as we say in the West. I
wouldn’t however,—at least I hope I wouldn’t have
tried to enter that in any case. But I know this old
shop as a boy and I couldn’t resist making an attempt
to get in here. Then—I got to thinking of old times
and—I have walked many miles during the last week—I
threw myself down on the old lounge and fell
asleep.”</p>

<p>He raised his eyes almost ingenuously to her, for
the moment a shy boy.</p>

<p>“I hate to think what a sad shock it must have
been to you coming upon me so,” he said contritely.
“You look ready to drop. Won’t you sit down? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
chair over yonder by the stair railing is all right for I
dusted it with my pocket handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” the girl faltered, “but——”</p>

<p>He understood. “Naturally you would like to get
out of here right away? May I help you down? The
stairway is steep and narrow and it is dark below.
But perhaps you would rather go alone?”</p>

<p>The girl’s heart throbbed strangely.</p>

<p>“I should like to get out into the air,” she said. “I
can get down all right, but——”</p>

<p>“May I come after and—explain myself?” he
asked. “I want you to understand and to feel safe
from further shocks of the sort.”</p>

<p>She murmured a confused affirmative and started to
feel her way down.</p>

<p>“Do you mind my shining a light?” he asked. “I
have an electric flash-light in my pocket, but please
don’t think me a professional burglar for all that.”</p>

<p>Alice tried to laugh, though she was still shaken.
He lighted her down and out, took her key, locked the
door and handed it back to her.</p>

<p>“You live in the house?” he asked.</p>

<p>Alice explained that she lived there with her mother
but that they were visiting in the part of the village
called South Hollow. She knew that she shouldn’t be
saying this to a stranger whom she had found in the
upper storey of the shop; but for herself she felt that
there are strangers and strangers.</p>

<p>“I know the Hollow,” he said. “I lived about here
as a boy. Are you going back now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Alice replies that she ought to be, but that she felt
as if she must sit down for a little first and would go
up to the porch. He accompanied her thither and
asked if he might wait. And when she gave the desired
permission, he suggested that she get herself a
wrap from the house. As she complied with the suggestion,
the girl seemed to feel her mother’s horror.
He unlocked the door for her and waited on the walk
below. When she came out and dropped down upon
one settee, he seated himself opposite.</p>

<p>“I want to apologise for my thoughtlessness which
might have had serious consequences,” he said quietly.
“And I give you my word that I will not come near
the place again so that you needn’t feel nervous about
coming in at any time. And—neither need your
mother. I suppose you will tell her?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I will,” said the girl slowly. “It
would frighten her unnecessarily and what’s the use?”</p>

<p>“None if you feel so,” he said. “I confess that I
shall be very glad if you do not, though I wouldn’t
stand in the way of your doing so if you feel it right.
As a matter of fact, I don’t want anyone to know I
am about here—or that anyone is about who is not
here ordinarily.”</p>

<p>“I won’t mention it,” she said.</p>

<p>“You are very good,” he returned simply.</p>

<p>For a little there was silence between them. Then
he spoke.</p>

<p>“I really want to stay about for a little,” he began
deprecatingly. “I have only just come, and—perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
you wouldn’t mind if I promise to keep away from
here? I have been away a long time. All sorts of
things have happened to me in the interval and also,
I dare say, to the people in Farleigh I used to know. I
am living and working in the Middle West. I saved
up money to take a vacation and come East and look
around. I don’t want people to see me but I want
to try to see some of those I used to think a lot of.
You will believe me, won’t you, when I say that I have
no other purpose in mind?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” the girl cried warmly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. It might well look queer to you for
me to be skulking about, but I simply cannot let anyone
know anything about me, and yet I long above all
things to find out about old friends—who is alive
and—and all that. I thought it would be simple, for
it is a very long time and I have changed so that I
felt I was safe. But I came upon a drummer in New
York who had known me only slightly and he recognised
me. That took away my nerve. I couldn’t bluff
now. So there’s nothing to do but to spy around
nights. I can only see who’s here and who——”</p>

<p>“If you don’t see them you won’t think they’re
dead?” protested the girl.</p>

<p>“The ones I care for would be dead if they weren’t
here,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>He said this so exactly as Dick Cartwright would
have said it, that it came to Alice Lorraine that it was
not unlikely that he was a relative of the dead man. He
looked enough like him—or like the image in Alice’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
mind which people who had known him had furnished
material for—to be his brother. He wasn’t old enough
to be his father nor young enough to be his son. Suppose
it was really Dick Cartwright that the stranger
had gone through so much to come and look up? How
terribly sad to find him dead! But if that should be
the case, it would, perhaps, be the kindest thing to tell
him at once. As she felt for words to introduce the
subject, it came to the girl that he would feel somewhat
comforted to hear of her idea of a memorial.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she began almost eagerly, then started
again quietly. “The man that built this house—the
shop was built years earlier, they tell me—he was—I
wonder if he was here in your day? His name was
Richard Cartwright.”</p>

<p>“O yes, I knew Cartwright,” he returned not at all
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“You may not have heard—that he is dead?” she
said softly.</p>

<p>“I understood he was. He came to a bad end, I
believe?”</p>

<p>“A sad end,” she amended with a trace of indignation.
“He was killed in a railway accident.”</p>

<p>“But he was himself a wreck long before that, I
believe,” he remarked. “However, you, being a
stranger, would not have heard I suppose. If you
hadn’t come to live in his house, you would never
have heard of him at all and then only because it is a
crazy-built house.”</p>

<p>“It’s a charming house,” the girl declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“It is attractive to look at,” he agreed, peering
through the dusk. “But—he is pretty well forgotten
by this time, I dare say?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he is, it isn’t fair! It isn’t fair at all!”
she cried.</p>

<p>He had nothing to say.</p>

<p>“Mr. Langley, the minister, whom everybody looks
up to, thought ever so much of Mr. Cartwright. I
don’t believe he has forgotten him,” she asserted.</p>

<p>“Mr. Langley! You know Mr. Langley!” he exclaimed.
“O tell me of him, please.”</p>

<p>“I have only seen him to speak to him once. But
he is—O very impressive—I mean you take to him
and feel he’s wonderful just as those who have always
known him do.”</p>

<p>“How does he look? But I shall see him. I must.
I’ll see him to-night. Does—but I ought not to let
you stay here longer. It’s dark already. My name is
John Converse. May I ask to whom I am indebted
for this kindness?”</p>

<p>“I am Alice Lorraine,” she said, rising reluctantly.</p>

<p>He asked if he might walk to the Hollow with her.
The girl hesitated, wondering if it were safe for him.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I am so shabby, Miss Lorraine,” he
said. “I have decent clothes over at Marsden Bridge
where I am staying—I didn’t dare risk Wenham—but
I am less likely to be recognized in these.”</p>

<p>They set out at once. But they had gone only a
few rods beyond the lane when the sound of light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
footsteps came clearly to them in the absolute stillness
of the damp autumn evening.</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Langley,” he said quietly. “I’ll have
to leave you. He’s the one person I dare not meet
even in black night.”</p>

<p>“O wait!” begged Alice in agonised whisper, panic
stricken at the thought that she would never see him
again. But at that moment a dark figure appeared in
sight. Alice pressed the keys into the stranger’s hand.
“To-morrow at four. I’ll come to the shop,” she whispered.
John Converse disappeared into the bushes
by the roadside.</p>

<p>It was barely a minute before Mr. Langley had
stopped and was calling her by name.</p>

<p>“Why Miss Lorraine, is it indeed you?” he cried,
surprised to see the girl out alone after dark. He
bade her come back as far as the Smiths’ with him
that he might get their horse and drive her back to
Miss Penny’s, giving her no opportunity to refuse.</p>

<p>They were hardly in the carriage when Alice turned
to the minister.</p>

<p>“Mr. Langley, I heard lately of a man returning to
his birthplace after years of absence longing to find
out all about the friends of his boyhood and to see them
if he could do it secretly. How would you account for
such a thing?”</p>

<p>Though Mr. Langley was quite accustomed to being
bombarded with odd questions, sometimes hypothetical,
sometimes otherwise, he hesitated now. He could not
say to this girl whose father was in prison that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
obvious solution of her problem was that the man had
committed a crime and was a fugitive from justice or
was ashamed of his record. But before the pause
became awkward an happy suggestion came to his
mind.</p>

<p>“Well, it might be another case of Enoch Arden,”
he said. “This man might have been missing for so
long that he had been taken for dead. That used to
be very common in sea-faring places and among sea-faring
people. His wife or sweet-heart may have
married another. Or I can imagine a man being unwilling
to make himself known when relatives have
come into possession of his more material property.”</p>

<p>Alice’s heart leaped. She remembered Enoch Arden
only vaguely, but enough to feel a thrill at her heart
at the thought of re-reading it in her bed that night.
There was a copy of Tennyson’s complete poems in
the book-case of the room she occupied—which was
Reuben’s old room.</p>

<p>The Smiths’ horse was a fine, strong creature which
did not get sufficient exercise, but he didn’t fancy
starting out just at supper time any more than Miss
Penny’s fat pony, and he showed his reluctance plainly.
It came to Alice that this was her chance to find out
more of Richard Cartwright. She had said she would
seize her first opportunity. Besides, Mr. Converse had
spoken slightingly of him. It wouldn’t be bad to have
Mr. Langley’s own word as to his respect and admiration
for the dead genius.</p>

<p>“O Mr. Langley, I have—well living in the cottage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
where he lived I suppose it is natural for me to wonder
about Mr. Cartwright,” she observed. “But—no one
seems to have anything to say about him. Of course,
he can’t be forgotten?”</p>

<p>“His son has rather overshadowed Cartwright’s
memory,” Mr. Langley remarked quietly.</p>

<p>“One certainly hears enough of <i>him</i>,” the girl
remarked.</p>

<p>“O Miss Lorraine, I hope you and your mother
aren’t getting the impression that Reuben is anything
of a prig,” he protested, “for he isn’t. He is—well,
he is four-square, that boy is, Miss Lorraine, and I
am happy to think that you will see him and judge
for yourself in the Christmas holidays.”</p>

<p>“I shall be pleased, I’m sure,” she murmured conventionally.
“But I can’t help being more interested
in the father,—being so musical and wanting a pipe
organ in his house and dying before it ever came to
him. You knew him well, Mr. Langley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew—and loved the man well,” he said
sadly. “He was a charming fellow, the best of companions
and friends.”</p>

<p>“And he played—well?”</p>

<p>“To me he seemed almost a genius,” he replied, and
Alice heard herself repeating it triumphantly to John
Converse.</p>

<p>“And yet—people have forgotten him already!” she
exclaimed. “One would think—O Mr. Langley, has
there ever been any idea of a memorial for him here
in Farleigh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“O no, nothing of the kind,” he said in some surprise.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think there should be?” she cried.</p>

<p>“In his case, I think it is better as it is,” he said.</p>

<p>Alice’s heart sank. O dear, how terribly strict Mr.
Langley was!</p>

<p>“You mean because he drank?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t mean that,” he said slowly. “I believe
his taking to drink as he did shows weakness, but I
cannot judge Dick Cartwright too severely for that.
His artistic temperament made him different. Grief
was truly more terrible to him and temptation stronger
than to less gifted mortals. And when he went away
and deserted his little son he was hardly a responsible
person.”</p>

<p>Alice was silent until lights twinkling in the Hollow
reminded her that she had only a few minutes. “But
surely, Mr. Langley, you wouldn’t have him forgotten?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Langley realised that Alice Lorraine was a girl
of some force. She was apparently intent upon obtaining
justice to Dick Cartwright’s memory—which
must not be.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, Miss Lorraine,—for I am going to
tell you something in strict confidence. It is for the
best that Richard Cartwright be forgotten save in the
minds of a few friends. He died in a railway wreck,
it is true, but he was not an innocent victim. I myself
thought him to have been at first. I wrote to a friend
in Chicago hoping he might secure details which might
be of comfort to Cartwright’s friends and later to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Reuben. But I regretted my action. My friend
learned that Cartwright had turned ruffian and desperado.
He was a member of a gang that killed the
mail clerk and the engineer and thus wrecked the
train.”</p>

<p>He sighed. He didn’t say that if Cartwright had
not been killed he would to-day be serving life sentence
in prison with others of the gang who had
escaped. But he felt compelled to add: “I dislike to
believe it and do not, but one of the men said that
Cartwright fired the shot that killed the mail clerk. So
I do not wish any attempt to revive the remembrance
of Reuben’s father.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” cried Alice. “I understand, and—thank
you, Mr. Langley. I am sorry to have awakened
sad memories for you.”</p>

<p>The house was in darkness but Alice did not mind
that. Relieved at the absence of Miss Penny and her
mother she rushed upstairs and removing her wraps
threw herself on the bed, her thoughts a wild chaos.
She did not know how long she had been there when
she heard her name called from below.</p>

<p>Going down, she found Anna’s brother Frank who
had lighted the lamp.</p>

<p>“I guess you were scared about your mother and
Miss Penny,” the boy said sympathetically, gazing at
her white face. “They thought you’d be, but they
clean forgot. They’re over to our house. Anna’s
come home and—something terrible’s happened to
her!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the afternoon following Alice Lorraine’s
strange adventure, Mr. Langley sat at his study
window gazing out over the pickets of the paling
towards the bushes and scrub trees which marked the
line of the river, but which, being mainly oaks, still
hid the stream itself from view. He was ready for
Sunday even to the point of having tidied his desk so
that it looked unfamiliar. He was conscious—vaguely
conscious—of working better and more easily
of late—with more spirit. It might be that it was
only a sort of rebound after the period of depression
into which he had fallen when someone had reminded
him of the fact that Ella May, whom he had always
thought of as a little girl, would now have been a
woman grown, older than her mother had been at her
birth, and he had lost the child-companion of his
thoughts and wanderings. Even so, something must
have happened from without himself to pull him out
of that slough. That something was, of course, connected
with his wife’s new interest in life—at least
in so much of life as was represented by the other
Miller girl.</p>

<p>It was probably recollection of Anna that made him
think at first glance that the figure coming along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
avenue at a distance beyond the lane was Anna, but,
looking again, he saw that it was someone else—one
of the grammar school children, he fancied, though
he couldn’t seem to place her. He didn’t try long, for
as his eyes dwelt upon that particular spot, something
disconcerting came suddenly to him. Last evening as
he had walked slowly homewards just before full darkness,
he had looked up at this point to see approaching
him the figures of a man and woman or youth and
maiden whom one glance showed to be intensely
interested in one another or in a common subject and
who seemed to be strangers to him. Then he had utterly
forgotten them. For he had been arrested by a loud
chattering in a tree at the roadside and had gone to see
why a squirrel should be awake at that time of day.
Then, walking on, he had met Alice Lorraine. She
was alone, but—the minister shook his head. It
seemed now to him that the figure of the girl he had
seen walking with the strange man was Alice Lorraine.</p>

<p>And yet—it couldn’t be. The man and woman
weren’t figments of his imagination, he was sure of
that. They must, however, have turned back at that
point for some reason. And quite likely he had stood
looking for and calling to the squirrel longer than he
had realised and Alice had come along meantime.</p>

<p>The click of his gate recalled his thoughts sharply.
On a sudden the man sat erect and stared—almost
glared at the strange yet familiar figure he saw coming
slowly up the flagged walk. For an instant he could
not believe it—could not credit the evidence of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
eyes. Then he recollected the preceding Saturday
and—O, that sermon of Sunday! And he groaned
within his heart. Had that child been so affected as
to sacrifice her vanity thus? It was worse than absurd.
It was cruel, monstrous!</p>

<p>He went to the door to let her in.</p>

<p>“Anna, take off your hat,” he bade her, his voice
stern through repressed feeling.</p>

<p>Obeying silently, Anna Miller stood before him
with downcast eyes. She looked like a boy,—a handsome
lad of perhaps a dozen years. Her long yellow
hair had been shorn. Parted at one side, the thick,
short unruly locks curled about her peaked face and
pipe-stem neck, emphasizing the childish delicacy of
her features, the long curling eyelashes and the sweet
curve of her mouth. Later Mr. Langley realised this,
and the fact that though Anna looked younger, she
had somehow quite lost whatever it was in expression
or countenance that likened her to a doll. He, who
had never acknowledged that likeness while it existed,
became aware of it after it had been displaced by something
else. But at the moment the loss seemed irreparable
and entire; the hard ugly fact seemed quite
without extenuation.</p>

<p>With an effort the girl raised her eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Mrs. Langley wants to see me?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“She always wants to see you, Anna,” he returned
half absently, frowning unconsciously. But as she
made a move to go in, he arrested her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Why have you done this foolish thing, tell me,
child!” he demanded reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Because—well—” Anna choked—“Honestly, Mr.
Langley, I <i>can’t</i> tell you now,” she faltered. “Ma cried
and Miss Penny and even Mrs. Lorraine, and Pa took
to the wood-pile. It’s only—a sort of a joke.”</p>

<p>“A poor sort of joke, it seems to me,” he remarked
and betook himself to his study.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley cried, too. But whereas one would
have deprecated Anna’s mother’s tears and Miss
Penny’s, it was probably good for Mrs. Langley to
forget herself for the moment and be really moved by
something beyond her immediate narrow horizon. It
was, perhaps, fortunate for her that after all those
arid, selfish years she had tears of sympathy to weep.</p>

<p>Anna found her looking better. Since the girl had
begun to visit her, Mrs. Langley had slept at night
and suffered less and less pain during the day. This
afternoon she wore an old-fashioned lace fichu over
her ugly Mother Hubbard gown which so relieved the
sharpness of her face and the yellow tone of her skin,
that Anna had no hesitation in kissing her when she
saw that it was expected of her.</p>

<p>But as she stood before her, suddenly Mrs. Langley
raised both hands and cried out.</p>

<p>“Anna Miller! Your lovely hair!” she exclaimed
incredulously, “you’ve had it all cut off!” And covering
her face with her hands she began to weep.</p>

<p>Anna, who had had a hard week and a difficult
home-coming, was startled and distressed. She stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
quite still with tightly clasped hands. It might kill
an invalid to cry like that. If they knew, they would
never let her in again. What if Big Bell should come
in now—or Mr. Langley? How angry he would be!
Anna hadn’t supposed he had it in him until she had
heard his voice to-day. He was probably thinking
then that it would be a shock to his wife, and that she
was a hateful thing not to have thought of it.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Langley! Her shoulders were shaking.
Anna went closer and put her arm about her gently.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry. Don’t feel badly about me, Mrs.
Langley,” she begged softly. “It’ll grow out again.
I’m awfully sorry, but honest and true, I couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley uncovered her face.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t help it?” she repeated wonderingly,
adding with more spirit than she had ever exhibited
before since Anna had known her. “Do you mean
that someone cut it off by force and stole it? O, Anna,
if they did that, I’ll have Mr. Langley put them in
prison right away!”</p>

<p>Anna couldn’t help laughing. But she said to herself
it wasn’t bad for Mrs. Langley to believe her
husband was Charley-on-the-spot, whether he really
was or not.</p>

<p>“Well, no’m, not just that,” she said, “but——”</p>

<p>“But what?” demanded the invalid rather sharply.</p>

<p>“I haven’t told anyone yet,” replied Anna softly.
“I just let them think that I—just did it, you know,
and that I like it better. I thought they wouldn’t mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
so much as if they really knew. But I’ll tell you if you
want me to.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley gazed at the girl wonderingly. Anna
was pale and there were bluish shadows under her eyes
which looked very big and rather wistful to-day.
Already Mrs. Langley began to feel that if she could
but forget that shimmering mass of gold about her
shoulders of a week since, she might like her even
better as she was now. The short locks curled so
gracefully and stood out so picturesquely about her
little face and slender throat that her head was like
a bright, loose-petalled flower upon its stem.</p>

<p>“Do tell me about it, Anna, if you’re not too tired,”
she said wistfully, endeavoring rather vainly to soften
her harsh voice. “No, don’t sit there, poor child. You
shall have this soft rocking chair for your sharp little
bones.” And before Anna realised what she was
doing, she had risen and forced the girl into her own
padded rocker.</p>

<p>Of course Anna would not keep it, but she drew
another close. She rather shrank from making the
explanation; but she said to herself sagely that it
might do Mrs. Langley good to hear it, and it might
forward a certain scheme she had in mind—a wonderful
plan that was to crown all her endeavors and make
everyone happy. Apparently it hadn’t hurt her to
cry, for she had hopped out of that rocking chair and
whisked her into it as nimbly and neatly as any strong
person could have done. <i>She should worry!</i></p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Langley, you see I found my friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Bessy very bad off,” she began. “It was all very sad
because Joe her husband wasn’t long dead, and there
was the baby, little Joe, Junior, and her chum Hazel
sticking by her through everything and supposing she
had lost her job, though they took her back again. I
slept with Hazel Monday night and woke up towards
morning and found her crying. It seemed that Bessy
had enough laid up to bury her; but she’d been sick so
long that Hazel had just had to break into it, what
with medicine and the baby’s milk, and of course she
had to have something to eat herself or she couldn’t
have done for Bessy. And here it was almost gone,
and Bessy didn’t know it had been touched, and was
feeling so secure about it. You might not think anyone
would mind, Mrs. Langley, but there’s something
frightful in the idea of being buried by charity.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Mrs. Langley assented absently.</p>

<p>“Charity down there doesn’t mean what it does
with us, you see,—public charity isn’t like the charity
of the Bible, you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley nodded impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, I managed to get Hazel chirked up so that
she went to sleep, and I lay staring at the smoky ceiling
and wondering what to do. Then suddenly I had a
hunch. And the very first thing in the morning I
went down to Mason and Martin’s and talked with a
woman in the hair goods I used to know that had first
put me wise about such things. She gave me a tip and
the people she sent me to offered me sixty-five dollars
for my hair—the braid was almost a yard long and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
about as thick at one end as at the other, you know.
Then I went back and told Hazel I could get sixty-five
dollars for her at any moment. She thought it was
a diamond ring or family jewels I could put in soak,
which wouldn’t of course mean much at a time like
that, and she cheered right up. And Bessy seemed to
feel a change and to be really better, and we all talked
about old times in the store and laughed a lot. But
that was Bessy’s last day. She died in the night. In
the morning I went down—and got the money.”</p>

<p>Unconsciously the girl drew a deep sigh even as she
forced a little plaintive smile. Mrs. Langley sighed yet
more deeply. She wasn’t sufficiently practical to ask
any of the obvious questions or to suggest the alternatives
with which others were to confront and confound
the girl even though they were quite futile now
that the deed was done.</p>

<p>“It was good of you, Anna,—it was a beautiful
thing to do,” she acknowledged, “only I am afraid you
will be sorry.”</p>

<p>“I should worry. It will be good for me, and a
lot less strain on the looking glasses,” the girl owned,
shrugging her shoulders. “And anyhow, Mrs. Langley,
I never could be sorry, after seeing real things like
I saw there: Bessy only barely two years older than I
and Hazel just my age, and—O, I’m so thankful it
was so long and not thin and that I had sense to think
of it in time. Honest and true, I don’t believe I could
ever be happy again or sleep nights if we had had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
call in—outsiders. But you never could understand
that without being right there.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley sighed again.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall sort of miss it,” Anna rattled on.
“I used to brush it at night, have it all over me, you
know, and Rusty would tease me. And I simply loved
the feel of that fat braid flopping about. But it’s just
as well, for I sha’n’t have so much time now.”</p>

<p>“You look—O, Anna, at this moment you look just
as my baby would have looked when she began to run
about!” cried Mrs. Langley almost enthusiastically.
“But please don’t put on your hat now. You have
only just come.”</p>

<p>“I really must. Ma thought I ought not to come
at all, but I felt as if I must get it over—about my
hair, you know.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re staying at home,” remarked Mrs.
Langley with her occasional acuteness as to the present
moment. “When do you go back to Miss Penny?”</p>

<p>The girl hesitated. “Not for some little time, Mrs.
Langley.”</p>

<p>It would have seemed that Mrs. Langley <i>must</i> have
asked the desired question. But the invalid was thinking
of herself.</p>

<p>“O Anna, how very nice! You won’t be nearly so
busy, then, and can get over here oftener. I wish
you would come regularly in the middle of the week,
too. Can you?” she asked promptly.</p>

<p>Anna sighed. “The fact is, I’m going to be a heap
busier—that’s why I’m staying at home,” she returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
obscurely. “But Mrs. Langley, some of the ladies
would just love to drop in to see you.”</p>

<p>“Anna Miller, I don’t know what you are thinking
of,” Mrs. Langley complained feebly, falling back in
her chair. “I have been an invalid since my baby died.
I couldn’t endure seeing anyone.”</p>

<p>“You see me.”</p>

<p>“That’s very different. Besides, you took an
interest in my baby’s grace. No one else did that.
Even the baby’s father——”</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Langley,” Anna interrupted quickly, “Mr.
Langley doesn’t—he’s a real true-blue Christian, you
know. He doesn’t think of Ella May as dead, and
so——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. But I wish that if you aren’t
going back to Miss Penny’s you’d come right here and
stay all the time.”</p>

<p>Anna could scarcely restrain a groan. “I’m needed
at home,” she said briefly and drew her jacket together.
But after all, the real business of her call hadn’t been
touched upon.</p>

<p>“You knew that there was a baby, too—little Joe,
Junior?” she asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley assented without interest.</p>

<p>“He was left pretty much alone, poor little lamb,
wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I suppose the girl Hazel would look after him?”</p>

<p>Anna’s eyes flashed. “She makes seven dollars and
a half a week—that’s every penny she has to live on.
Even if she could work with him on her hands, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
couldn’t buy his milk with what was left each week.”</p>

<p>“O, I see. I suppose she will put him in an orphan
asylum?”</p>

<p>“Orphan asylum nothing!” cried Anna and waited
a minute. Then as Mrs. Langley did not speak she
said casually: “I brought him home with me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley sat up straight. “Anna Miller!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“There was nothing else to do and anyhow I wanted
to. The little beggar needs fresh air and sunshine
and—Farleigh.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that you’re going to keep him?”
Mrs. Langley protested.</p>

<p>Anna’s heart sank. She had truly decided to bring
the baby home because there had seemed no alternative.
But no sooner was she out of the sadness and confusion
and settled in the train than she had realised
the fitness, the inevitability of her action. She was
bringing the baby straight to Mrs. Langley. A baby
was exactly what Mrs. Langley needed and wanted
and what Mr. Langley would enjoy most of anything.
If she had chosen, she would probably have had a
girl, but she wasn’t sure that that wouldn’t have been
a mistake. And though Anna, who was wild over all
young creatures, was attached to little Joe already,
she decided to hand him over to Mrs. Langley as soon
as the transfer could be affected. But even before
she had come to the parsonage to-day, she had realised
that it wasn’t altogether the simple matter it would
seem to be and that it wasn’t to be accomplished without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
finesse. Still she had expected one visit to finish
the negotiations,—and she had nearly missed mentioning
it at all!</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” she faltered. “That is, I’m going
to keep him of course until I find a good home for
him. I’d like to keep him always only—ma wasn’t so
tremendously pleased to have him added to her family,
and of course I wouldn’t have dreamed of taking him
to Miss Penny’s though she would have taken him in
forever if I had said the word. However, I own that
it was something of a surprise to ma—springing the
baby on her at the same time she saw my Sampson-Delilah
hair-cut. But heaps of people would give their
heads to get a nice baby ready-made just at the cunning
age, or nearly, and with the worst of his teething
over.”</p>

<p>She waited anxiously. Mrs. Langley only stared
at her.</p>

<p>“People that haven’t any children or people that
have lost children,—lost them when they were babies,
ought to jump at such a chance,” she went on, longing
to have Mrs. Langley ask some question, however
reluctantly, concerning the child. But the invalid
held up a protesting hand.</p>

<p>“Anna! I would never have believed that you
would speak in that unfeeling way about—the loss of
a baby!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” said Anna quickly. “I just
wanted—perhaps Mr. Langley might know of some
good home where they would take in the little fellow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Would you mind telling him about little Joe and asking
him?”</p>

<p>“Mind! Of course I would mind, Anna Miller!
I—I never could get through it!”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I shall have to see him myself,”
remarked Anna tentatively.</p>

<p>“Anna, Mr. Langley is an overworked man,” said
his wife rather surprisingly. “He has a great deal to
do as chairman of the school committee, besides all
his church business. Don’t go to him with any such
thing as that. And—O Anna, don’t say anything more
about it to me. Don’t mention the matter at all when
you come next Saturday—or Wednesday, if you can
come on Wednesday. I’m all upset.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the confusion and excitement which prevailed at
the two houses in the South Hollow in which this
narrative is concerned, Alice Lorraine’s secret perturbation
either remained unnoticed or was attributed to
the cause which affected them all. But very shortly
Mrs. Lorraine, who had come out of her shell almost
unbelievably in her week of companionship with Miss
Penny, so that now in the crisis she was a very tower
of strength not only to Miss Penny but to the Miller
household as well, began to be greatly troubled by her
daughter’s demeanour. She had rejoiced at the manner
in which the girl had bloomed under Anna’s influence,
and had been amazed not only at her capacity
for learning and power of adaptability but at the generous
warmth and sweetness of her nature. She had
believed that a real transformation had taken place.
Wherefore she was the more disappointed to discover
that, at a moment of crisis, Alice really wasn’t
the useful, helpful, sympathetic, understanding girl she
had seemed. Anna’s arrival, shorn of her wonderful
hair and accompanied by the strange, unattractive,
almost uncanny baby, had upset Miss Penny’s household
and all but devastated the Millers’. And Alice,
who might have cheered the former immensely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
have been of great service in restoring equanimity to
the other, seemed completely unstrung by the excitement
and a subject rather than a source of aid.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, when she caught sight of
Alice, who supposed herself alone, wringing her hands
as she stood by a window of the living-room looking
north, Mrs. Lorraine sighed and said to herself, in
Anna’s expressive phrase, that it seemed to be ‘up to’
her. And summoning all her powers, some of which
had been awakened of late and others which had lain
dormant almost all her life, Henrietta Lorraine started
in good earnest to bring some sort of order out of
chaos.</p>

<p>She began with Miss Penny. It did not take long
to reconcile that philosophical and optimistic little lady
to the loss of the yard of silken tresses; and after a
bit Mrs. Lorraine convinced her that Anna would soon
pick up again now that she was at home, would regain
at least as many pounds as she seemed to have lost, and
would lose the hurt, mournful look that close association
with death in such sad circumstances had left in
her merry eyes. Moreover, the care of the baby need
not fall wholly upon her. There were plenty of people
about to help.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Mrs. Lorraine, Anna knows of people
that will take the child,” Miss Penny owned. “That’s
the queer part of it—she wanted a baby for these very
people. Of course, she wouldn’t have had—but after
this afternoon—it’s Saturday, you know—I can probably
tell you all about it. And—O Mrs. Lorraine, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
hope you won’t feel that you must leave me right
away. I have enjoyed having you here so much. And
it is such a relief to have an older person to talk to
now all this has happened. Dear me! it’s almost like
having Reuben back—and I have only known you a
week.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine smiled. “We will stay as long as you
are alone, Miss Penny,” she assured her. “There is
nothing to call us back after all to that bare little
cottage.”</p>

<p>“Then—O Mrs. Lorraine, why not spend the winter
with me?” Miss Penny cried eagerly. “It would make
me so happy. You could have a separate sitting-room,
if you liked and—O, you would be here Christmas to
see Reuben! And Anna ought to be at home while
Rusty’s away, anyhow. It is so hard on her mother
lending her to me. I feel troubled about it all the
time—and yet, I cannot get on alone. And of course
I would pay Alice just as I do Anna so that it needn’t
make any difference and you can do your embroidery
as well here as—O Mrs. Lorraine, we could get back
my other cow and make butter! We both love to do
it and I am sure you could make more money in that
way and—O don’t say no! Dear me! I wish Mr.
Langley would come in!”</p>

<p>“I won’t say no, and I will think it over. And we
will stay on anyhow until Anna gets rested, and so we
may as well get the cow back in the shed and begin
making butter,” returned Mrs. Lorraine quietly though
not without secret excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>At dinner, Alice could not eat and her mother was
distressed. Afterwards she persuaded Miss Penny to
lie down and then told Alice to go to her room to rest.
Not long afterwards the girl appeared in the living-room
in her prettiest suit with a jaunty little hat over
her dark plaits. Mrs. Lorraine looked up in some
surprise.</p>

<p>“You are going out, Alice?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I want—I am going for a walk. I
think—I will walk down to the cottage and bring
back—some things.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t go with you and I don’t like your going
into that empty house alone.”</p>

<p>“O it’s perfectly safe. They say it’s safe everywhere
about Farleigh,” murmured Alice uneasily.</p>

<p>“Alice, you must not do it,” declared Mrs. Lorraine
with new decision—for it was wise and kind and
<i>motherly</i>.</p>

<p>“Very well, I won’t go in,” said Alice in an odd
voice.</p>

<p>Her mother looked at her. “You are restless, dear.
You are more upset, now, over Anna’s escapade even
than Miss Penny at her age. You feel as if you
wanted to get away from everything for a little and
I don’t blame you. But—we can’t do that any more,
dear, you and I. That is what we have always done,
though it isn’t your fault. And anyhow we have to
make up now. Let me tell you what to do. Miss
Penny says Anna feels obliged to go over to the parsonage
this afternoon. Suppose you go over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Millers’ and stay until she comes back? You can help
take care of the baby. You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go right over,” said Alice, and would have
started but her mother arrested her.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better change your suit, Alice? To-morrow
is Sunday, and if you get it creased there’d be
no chance to press it to-night.”</p>

<p>Already Alice had expended considerable nervous
energy on the subject of her dress. At one moment,
she had felt as if she should don her poorest gown out
of consideration for the shabbiness of the stranger.
Again, that had seemed a shabby thing to do and she
had decided to wear her most attractive things to
accord, not with the stranger’s garb but with his
manner and bearing. Then she would think of the
dusty shop and waver. She might never have any
more new clothes and perhaps it was foolish to risk
spoiling a really handsome suit for the sake of making
a good appearance before a stranger whom she didn’t
know whether she liked and whom she would probably
never see after to-day.</p>

<p>Then she said that she knew that she liked him.
And besides, she had to have excitement after having
had that beautiful, romantic image of Dick Cartwright
so cruelly shattered before her eyes. She didn’t know
how she should bear that if it wasn’t for looking forward
to seeing John Converse. And she <i>would</i> see
him again after to-day. She would have to—for she
meant to help him in his quest. And to-day she was
to be as nice as she knew how to be and as interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
in helping him plan, and she would also look as well
as it was in her power to look, so that altogether it
would seem pleasant to him or not boresome to see
her again.</p>

<p>She said now to her mother that she would be careful
not to muss her skirt, and Mrs. Lorraine did not
protest further. But she breathed a sigh of relief as
she saw her at the Miller’s gate. She felt that Alice
would be all right after an hour with the baby. For
though he wasn’t a very attractive baby, he appealed
to Mrs. Lorraine. He was quiet, he didn’t cry nor
fuss, and he was a baby-creature.</p>

<p>But he wasn’t to have a chance that day. For not
long after, the two girls left the house together. Alice
had explained that her mother sent her over to help
but that she had planned to go to the cottage to get
the keys she had left there the day before. Anna
declared that the baby was asleep and that there was
nothing to do, and begged her to come along and tell
her on the way of what had happened during her
absence.</p>

<p>“I can’t get a sane, sensible word out of anyone.
Braids of yellow hair and orphan babies are the only
subjects people will mention to-day,” she added drolly
and yet a bit plaintively. “And I’m fed up with the
matter of yellow hair, and if I am going to talk about
babies, it’s with people that appreciate their fine points
better than anyone I have seen thus far.”</p>

<p>As they parted at the lane, Alice begged Anna not to
say anything about her having come to the cottage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Anna assented without question and went on to the
parsonage.</p>

<p>Alice Lorraine stole softly up the lane. There was
no one in sight and no sound. She was earlier than
the hour she had named and she went round the house
and sat down on the step of the kitchen porch. After
a little she stole part way down the overgrown path
to the shop and back again. The shop looked as empty
as the house,—nay, emptier. The girl was convinced
that there was no one there. And her heart grew cold
at the thought that four o’clock might come and yet
bring no one.</p>

<p>Suppose he shouldn’t come? John Converse had
the key not only to the shop but to the house. Suppose
he had been—well, the sort of person her mother, for
example, might guess him to be upon hearing the
story? He wasn’t, but—something might have happened.
He might be ill at the hotel at Marsden Bridge
or—any number of things might have happened to
prevent his coming. And he had the keys! Suppose
her mother should want to get into the cottage
to-morrow?</p>

<p>The girl rose and ran swiftly but quietly to the shop.
Her heart was in her mouth as she knocked softly on
the door, so softly that the sound wouldn’t have been
heard from the porch she had just left. The door
opened and the stranger held it wide for her.</p>

<p>Another stranger to-day! And it wasn’t only the
dear light that made the difference. John Converse
might have been another person from the man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
yesterday. He was dressed well,—almost elegantly.
Certainly his suit, though it had a sack coat, was of
fine material and good make and he wore a silk shirt
and jaunty tie as if he were used to such informal
elegance; and all the accessories were in keeping down
to his neat shoes. He was not less thin nor pale—his
face was almost cadaverous in the stronger light. But
his eyes were merry and full of life, his rather large,
thin-lipped mouth puckered with amusement at her
wonderment, and there was a boyish eagerness about
him that was flattering and very grateful to the girl’s
perturbed spirit.</p>

<p>They shook hands gravely.</p>

<p>“It is more than good of you to come,” he said.</p>

<p>Alice Lorraine gave a little cry.</p>

<p>“Why, what have you done!” she exclaimed and
looked about her as if frightened.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down and take in the magnificence
at your ease?” he asked with a whimsical charm which
seemed native to him. And Alice dropped into the
large and comfortable wooden chair he indicated which
was not only free from dust but had apparently been
scrubbed clean.</p>

<p>Likewise the whole place. The room had been
cleared of rubbish and transformed by the magic of
strong, eager hands and soap and water to a quaintly
attractive sitting-room. The bareness added to its
apparent size. Odd bits of hand-made furniture were
disposed gracefully about and every natural comeliness
made the most of. Even the stairway added something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
to the general attractiveness. A bit of old rug
lay before it and another at the door. The windows
had a strip of dark cloth above for a blind and a white
curtain over the lower sash. A small sheet-iron stove,
still rusty, but clean, warmed the place and held a tiny
kettle in which the water was boiling. A stand in the
corner was covered by a white tea cloth, apparently
just out of the shop, and held a tea pot and two cups,
which were also new and gaudily pretty, and a plate of
sweet biscuit.</p>

<p>“O Mr. Converse, you are a wizard surely!” cried
the girl. “I really believe that you could turn yourself
into whatever you wished. You could be an old gypsy
woman or a fat man with bright-red hair and could
walk the streets of Farleigh by day.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “It was soap and water and elbow
grease that did this. I am afraid they wouldn’t presto-change
me so easily.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly he paled. “Nevertheless, I have seen
the time when soap and water might have worked
wonders with me,” he declared bitterly. Alice looked
at him in consternation.</p>

<p>“Pardon me. It was awfully good of you to come,”
he said in another tone. “I hoped you would, and I
believed you would unless you were prevented. And
really——”</p>

<p>“You will stay right here now that you have made
it so comfortable, won’t you?” Alice asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“O, I didn’t do it for that. I wanted to have a
decent place for you to come to,” he said, boyishly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
ingenuous. Despite his gaunt face, which was also
lined, and his grey hair, he was really youthful as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“What a lot of work for a person you never saw
but once,” she said. “I felt last night—when we saw
Mr. Langley, you know—that we hadn’t settled anything—I
mean, I thought I might help you—tell you
about people or find out about those I don’t know—but——”</p>

<p>She paused. “I’m talking for all the world like
Miss Penny,” she owned. “What I mean to say is
that I am glad I did manage to arrange to see you
to-day and that I was able to get away. And I am glad
you have done this because it will make it comfortable
for you. You can stay here as long as you choose—make
it your headquarters.” And she went on to say
that she and her mother were to remain at the Hollow
for some time.</p>

<p>“You will stay, won’t you?” she begged.</p>

<p>“It would be perfectly bully if I could,” he cried
eagerly. “I could—well, reconnoiter from here in
grand style.”</p>

<p>But as he referred to his purpose in this region, the
boyish look fled and he looked sad and perhaps old.
And Alice remembered Enoch Arden and her heart
ached for him.</p>

<p>But he was a boy again as he made the tea, served
her, and sat down with his own cup. Alice, too, was a
younger girl than she would have been if she had
never known Anna Miller. They dallied happily over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the ceremony and afterwards went to the top of the
stair so that Alice might see the change in the upper
chamber, which was as wonderful as that below. The
upper room, indeed, with its tent roof, beams, rafters
and brick chimney, its window at either end and its
built-in benches was more attractive than the lower.
Alice rather hoped John Converse would suggest their
sitting there, but he did not, and they returned to their
chairs in the lower apartment to begin finally upon
the real business of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I don’t really know how to start out,” Alice remarked.
“The people I know best are Miss Penny and
the Miller family.”</p>

<p>“In my day there were no Millers in Farleigh—except
the moth millers,—dusty-millers, we used to call
them. I remember Miss Penny, however,—a little old
maid who always came to church. She drove a fat
pony. I suppose that is dead long ago?”</p>

<p>“I’m learning to drive him. I feed him sugar every
day,” said Alice. “But I am wasting time. Suppose
you ask me questions.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you tell me a bit more about that
Cartwright fellow you mentioned yesterday.”</p>

<p>Alice paled. She didn’t want to think of Dick Cartwright
now.</p>

<p>“I was all wrong,” she said in a low, pained voice.
“He wasn’t good. He was—O, a dreadful man.”</p>

<p>“Why Miss Lorraine! what do you mean?” he
asked. And she thought he had noticed her secret pain.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you what he did. Mr. Langley told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
in confidence and I really ought not to say anything,”
she returned sadly. “Mr. Langley’s the only one
who—well, he’s very anxious that this Richard Cartwright
should be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“But I thought—didn’t you tell me yesterday that
Mr. Langley was this man’s friend?”</p>

<p>“O yes. But this is on account of the son, Reuben.
He’s a fine boy, everyone says, and he’s in college.
Mr. Langley doesn’t want him to know how bad his
father was. And he doesn’t want people to be thinking
and talking of him for fear—well, he says it is best
that he be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“I told you I knew Mr. Langley once. I should
have thought of him as being faithful to the end of
things,” he said bitterly.</p>

<p>“He was faithful to the end of things,” the girl
rejoined warmly. “He——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. There’s no such thing to-day as faithfulness,”
he declared bitterly.</p>

<p>Afterwards, as she lay in her bed at night—Alice
remembered Enoch Arden and wondered if he had
learned of his wife’s unfaith and that had made him
so bitter. At this moment, however, the girl was too
wrought up to think of aught but the matter under
discussion.</p>

<p>“There is, too. There is—ever so much!” she cried
hotly.</p>

<p>“Not at all. One faces this way—a tiny breath of
wind, and round goes the weather-cock!”</p>

<p>“I should think—” the girl began indignantly. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
didn’t pause because she didn’t exactly know what it
was she should think but because he was looking at her
with a strange, half-hurt, half-angry look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Even you, Miss Lorraine,—pardon me, but aren’t
you really an example? Wasn’t it only yesterday that
you were saying that it wasn’t fair that this man who
had loved music and planned higher things than his
weakness could fulfill should be utterly forgotten
because he ran amuck when his head was turned by
grief? And to-day—apparently you can’t think badly
enough of him!”</p>

<p>The girl’s heart throbbed wildly. A flaming colour
came to her cheeks giving her real beauty.</p>

<p>“Well, you yourself!” she cried hotly. “You—you
said nasty things yesterday about Dick Cartwright and
now, to-day, one would think he was your best——”</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped. She was aware of a disturbance
from without. Someone was calling her name
and banging on the door of the cottage. Now she realised
that it had been going on some time and she had
been vaguely aware of it. She sprang to her feet, her
face horror-stricken. Her mother had come for her!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANNA reached home worn and fatigued on that
Saturday afternoon only to learn that Alice Lorraine
was still absent. Without the knowledge of anyone,
she slipped out and returned to the lane. It was
she whom Alice heard pounding on the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Recognizing Anna, Alice clasped her in a hysterical
embrace.</p>

<p>“I thought it was—mother!” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! is her mother such an ogre as all
that!” Anna said to herself. Aloud she said lightly:
“What, with my bobbed hair? I like that. No, Alice
my child, your mother is waiting for you to join her at
supper, and we must hike. Don’t cry any more and
they won’t know. They’ll think it’s from running—for
we’d better run.”</p>

<p>Something in her brave, tired voice went to Alice’s
heart. She kissed her warmly.</p>

<p>“I’ll run, Anna dear, but you take your time,” she
bade her. But Anna stood firm. And though they did
not run, they walked fast and were not long in reaching
the Hollow. Just before they came to Miss
Penny’s, Alice spoke with effort.</p>

<p>“Anna, I want awfully to get down to the cottage
to-morrow. Do you suppose I can?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“It won’t be so easy, being Sunday. Could you
possibly wait until Monday?” Anna asked in troubled
tone.</p>

<p>“O Anna, not possibly!” cried the other girl vehemently,
remembering her parting with John Converse.
For they had been interrupted in the midst of what
was virtually a quarrel. Alice felt as if she could not
possibly let a day go by without seeing him and
straightening it out. Besides, if he didn’t see her to-morrow
he might feel that she was offended, or that
it had been her mother and she had forbidden her to
come near again.</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll fix it somehow,” Anna assured
her, and asked Alice if she wished her to go in with
her.</p>

<p>“O Anna, if you would!” cried Alice, throwing her
arm about her and embracing her warmly.</p>

<p>Thereafter for many days Anna Miller had an additional
burden upon her shoulders—the burden of
Alice Lorraine’s mystery. The change in Alice which
was inexplicable to Anna but which seemed painfully
obvious, she tried to keep from the knowledge of
others as she endeavored to cover up her secret visits
to the cottage she and her mother had occupied. She
did this cheerfully and willingly, but her heart was
heavy. For Alice did not seem happy at all. She
seemed nervous and apprehensive, so that Anna feared
the secret she was helping her to conceal was anything
but a pleasant one.</p>

<p>But for this, Anna would have been serene. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Mrs. Langley’s unexpected behaviour in respect to the
baby troubled her less and less as the days passed. She
still expected to hand the child over to the household
at the parsonage on some fine day, but she was ready
to wait. Indeed, but for the fact that the care of little
Joe during school hours fell upon her mother, she
would have been glad to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p>And as it was, the girl had never been so happy
with anyone or anything as she was with this forlorn
baby orphan. No one shared her enthusiasm in any
considerable measure. Alice Lorraine went into
ecstasies over little Joe by fits and starts and then forgot
all about him. Mrs. Lorraine was becoming
attached to him, and Anna’s father and the boys took
kindly to him. But Mrs. Miller disapproved thoroughly
of the whole affair,—the only instance of her
disapproval Anna had known since her return home.
And she remained unresigned to her part of minding
little Joe when Anna was at school, though he slept a
good part of the time and for the rest was, she had
to own, as little trouble as a child could be. She even
confessed, when pressed, that he was hardly more
bother than a kitten.</p>

<p>This was not exaggeration. Joe, Junior, occasioned
little trouble. On the other hand, he paid as little in
the coin of babyhood for such trouble as he gave as
could any human being at his interesting age. Not
only was he not irresistible but he was quite negligible,
unless, indeed, he aroused vague irritation in the mind
of the beholder because of his utter want of attractiveness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
He was thin and scrawny and sallow; his head
was too big for his emaciated little body, and his pale-coloured
eyes too big for his mite of an old man’s
face. His feet and hands were ugly claws, his legs
mere sticks—one would as quickly have looked for
dimples in the living skeleton of the circus. He had a
mere wisp of tow-coloured hair and never showed the
teeth he possessed. He never smiled, never, indeed,
looked other than woe-begone. Though he never cried
out and seldom whined or whimpered, he always
seemed to want sadly something that was never by
any chance what was proffered him.</p>

<p>But he clung to Anna, and though he was never
other than mournful even with her, he was passively
content. And Anna adored him. It was no task for
her to hurry home from school to relieve her mother—she
could scarcely wait to get at the baby after any
absence. He slept in an old cradle (salvaged from
Miss Penny’s garret) by the side of her bed, and the
girl was ready to get up at any hour of the night for
milk or water, and sang to him by the hour in her
sweet young voice. She spent nearly all the money she
had saved in a year in the purchase of a wardrobe for
the baby, who was the best-dressed child of his age,
or perhaps of any age, in the two villages. She took
pride and pleasure in ironing the frills and laces of his
little frocks and petticoats and in keeping him immaculately
tidy,—the latter being easy, as the baby never
played, and if he was placed on the floor never moved
from the spot. She brushed the scanty hair on top of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
his head, longing for the time when there should be
enough to make a curl.</p>

<p>But one day as she did this, it came to the girl that
when that time should come, in all likelihood Joe,
Junior, wouldn’t be with her. Her heart sank. And
it was borne in upon her that if she was to give the
baby away, it must happen very soon. A little later,
and it would be utterly impossible. Even now, she
wouldn’t have been able even to contemplate the idea
if it had been anyone but Mr. Langley who was to
benefit thereby.</p>

<p>Mr. Langley had been in to see little Joe and had
taken to him more warmly than anyone else had done,
unless one counted Alice in one mood. He had held
the baby all the while he stayed and hadn’t seemed to
know how to get away. He hadn’t seemed to feel any
want in him; he had admired him apparently as much
as Anna herself. He needed him more than she did,
of course, but O, he didn’t <i>want</i> him more!</p>

<p>He didn’t know that he wanted him, for he did not
dream that there was any chance of having him. Mrs.
Langley kept it dark—trust her!—and Anna didn’t
feel like saying anything until she was ready to receive
the child. Miss Penny was the only other person who
knew, and she, though she couldn’t keep a secret of
her own, was quite safe with that of another. But
he should know as soon as it was prudent, and that,
Anna decided, must be very soon. She said to herself
it was up to her to make what Caesar calls a forced
march.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Already she had talked to Mrs. Langley of the baby
for half an hour at a time, and had repeated her request
to be allowed to bring him to the parsonage. Mrs.
Langley always declared that it would break her heart
to see him but Anna felt that one glimpse of him
would settle the whole matter. Wherefore on the next
Saturday she announced that she meant to bring Joe,
Junior, with her that day-week.</p>

<p>For an instant the invalid’s eyes brightened. Then
she sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“O no, Anna, I couldn’t bear the sight of a baby.
It would break my heart,” she declared. And her
emotion was unfeigned.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t the same, Mrs. Langley, Joe, Junior,
being a boy,” Anna protested. “If he made you think
of anyone it wouldn’t be Ella May, it would be of that
little lamb.”</p>

<p>“O, is his hair curly?” asked the invalid eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not yet,” Anna admitted regretfully.
“But he has such a sober, meek little face, young, and
yet sort of sedate and oldish, too, you know, that he
makes me think of the little lamb.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, you are like a pretty lamb yourself, Anna,
with your fuzzy yellow hair. I believe I really like
you better with it cut so,” declared Mrs. Langley with
sudden enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“You’d better take a good look at it then, for it will
be longer before you see it again,” Anna suggested mischievously.
“I shan’t be hiking down to the parsonage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
for some time, you see. I can’t come any more unless
you let me bring Joe, Junior.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley clasped her thin hands. “O Anna,
don’t speak so even in fun,” she begged. “Of course
you will come next Saturday—or sooner if you have
a chance. Only please don’t mention that baby to me
again. It stirs me all up.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” the girl assented meekly, adding: “for
I sha’n’t be here to mention him or anything else.
Honest and true, I can’t come any more without him.
Whenever I am not in school, my place is with that
blessed little monkey, Mrs. Langley. It’s mighty good
of ma to mind him as much as she does since she
doesn’t take to him, but I don’t mean to put it over with
her unless I have to. And now it’s cold weather, the
boys want to skate Saturday afternoons—and before
long there’ll be sliding.”</p>

<p>“There’s that Alice Lorraine. How about her?”
demanded Mrs. Langley.</p>

<p>Anna opened her eyes very wide. Extremely vague
in general, unaware apparently of the existence of
anyone outside her own four walls, sometimes, when
her own interests were concerned, the woman was uncannily
acute.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Langley, I wouldn’t go off and leave that
precious child with Alice Lorraine. She’s dear, but
she’s absent-minded and I should be on pins and
needles all the while for fear he was being drowned
or scalded or kidnapped,” she declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“There’s that neighbor of Miss Penny’s, Mrs.
Phelps,” Mrs. Langley persisted.</p>

<p>“For the love of Mike!” cried the girl in utter
amazement. “Why, I should as soon think of asking
the Lord Mayor of London to run over every Saturday
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Well, there must be someone who lives near,” Mrs.
Langley murmured with unusual meekness.</p>

<p>“There isn’t, and anyhow, I wouldn’t trust Junior
with ’em!” cried Anna. And suddenly she lost her
temper,—something that was extremely rare with the
other Miller girl. “I simply can’t come again without
the baby and what’s more I won’t, so there! That’s
all there is to it. Cash down or no goods delivered!”</p>

<p>And she flung herself from the place like a small
whirlwind.</p>

<p>She had passed the lane, when she recollected Alice
Lorraine and paused. She had agreed to meet her at
the lane as near five as possible, and strolling back she
seated herself on the stone wall to consider. On other
occasions she had either just made the hour or had
been late, and she felt a certain hesitation about hanging
around the place for a matter of twenty minutes.
She said to herself sadly that it was just as if she
suspected Alice of meeting someone there, though she
knew—she hoped with all her heart she knew—that
Alice wouldn’t do such a thing. But O, what was her
secret? What was she doing, haunting the lane and
the cottage almost daily?</p>

<p>As she was pondering sadly, she heard a step,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and looked up to see Mr. Langley. Her heart sank.
She supposed he would reproach her for leaving Mrs.
Langley so rudely. But apparently he knew nothing
about it.</p>

<p>“O Anna, I wanted to speak to you and tried to get
home before you should leave,” he said. “Do you
mind coming back to my study for a few minutes?”</p>

<p>“What now?” the girl said to herself. But he was
all kindness as he led her back through the gate, helped
her off with her jacket and established her in the most
comfortable chair in his study.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you in regard to Miss Lorraine.
You know her well, I think, Anna?” he began at once.</p>

<p>“Why yes, Mr. Langley,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“And you like her? You—believe in her?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that. I like the girl so far as I
know her and I believe in her. But things look a bit
odd and I want to talk a little with you. People in the
village are talking about Miss Lorraine. Someone said
to me that at least two persons have seen her walking
at dusk with a strange man.”</p>

<p>“O Mr. Langley, I don’t believe that. There must
be some mistake!” cried Anna.</p>

<p>“I hope so and think so. And yet, do you know, I
thought myself I saw her walking one night with a
stranger. The other person disappeared and she was
alone when I met her. But I couldn’t shake off the
impression.”</p>

<p>Anna stared at him helplessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“There’s still more,” he went on reluctantly. “There
is, I fear, no doubt but that there is a strange man
hanging about the village—the Farleigh end. More
than two or three persons have declared they saw a
man peering in their windows. They connect this
man with Miss Lorraine. They say it is the same man
she walks with, and—dear me, her father being in
prison, it is so easy for people to lose their common
sense and originate all sorts of rumors.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Langley, surely you don’t believe that—about
a man looking into people’s windows?” Anna
demanded.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think. The truth is, that
before I heard any rumors—it was last Sunday evening—I
felt that there was someone looking in at me
through yonder window. I have always left the blind
up—until this week.”</p>

<p>“I feel stunned, Mr. Langley,” said Anna mournfully.</p>

<p>“Poor child! No wonder! I hated to bother you
with this, but dear me—I seem to be following the
lead of others and bringing my burdens to lay upon
your youthful shoulders. However—we cannot let
this go on. I am convinced that there is a mistake
and that Miss Lorraine can explain. Shall I speak
to her or would you rather, Anna?”</p>

<p>Anna considered. “Perhaps I’d better,” she said.
“But—I guess I won’t do anything until after to-morrow.
I’d better think it over first.”</p>

<p>Mr. Langley begged to drive her home, but recollecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
her promise to Alice she made an excuse. And
there was Alice waiting for her at the lane.</p>

<p>To-night Alice was in high spirits. First she asked
about the baby in a pathetically perfunctory way, then
she put a careless query in regard to Reuben. Anna’s
heart grew cold. What did it mean? Why was she
asking so many questions of late, particularly about
Reuben?</p>

<p>Reaching Miss Penny’s she went in with Alice, understanding
clearly now that Alice wished her mother
to think they had been together all afternoon. Mrs.
Lorraine looked up with troubled face.</p>

<p>“O Alice, I didn’t know you were going out this
afternoon,” she said. “We looked everywhere for
you. I wanted you to go over to Wenham to the
bank to see Mr. Clarke. If we are to stay here until
after Christmas, I feel as if we ought to give up the
cottage.”</p>

<p>Alice became very white. “We can’t give it up so
suddenly,” she said with a curious gasp. “You have
to—give notice.”</p>

<p>“It’s different in our case,” said Mrs. Lorraine,
paling herself. “But never mind now. I will write
a note and send it to-night. Miss Penny says Mr.
Phelps will take it.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night, mother,” the girl said quickly and
with a certain fierceness of determination. “Wait
till—next Saturday perhaps. I have—lost the key.
I’ll go over to-morrow and see if I can find it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Anna Miller had a concrete problem to
solve, it was her habit—rather more unconscious,
however, than deliberate—to put herself in
touch with the situation or the matter itself and trust
to her mother-wit for suggestions as to procedure.
Wherefore, as soon as Joe, Junior, fell asleep the following
afternoon, she betook herself over to Miss
Penny’s to see Alice. She had no plan. She only
wished to spend an hour in Alice’s company, after
which she might have something to meditate upon.</p>

<p>She found Mrs. Lorraine just finishing the washing-up
and was surprised that Alice would have left it to
her. Then she recollected the hour and wondered why
the work should have been delayed. As she enquired
for Alice with apparent unconcern, she saw that Mrs.
Lorraine’s face was flushed and that Miss Penny
showed traces of excitement, and guessed that something
had happened directly after dinner. It wasn’t
unlikely that there had been a discussion between Alice
and her mother and that Alice had flown.</p>

<p>“Alice is up in her chamber lying down, Anna dear,”
Miss Penny informed her. “She may be asleep, but
you are so quiet you may steal up to see if you like.”</p>

<p>Anna gazed enquiringly at Mrs. Lorraine, who
begged her to sit down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Have you noticed anything strange about Alice
lately, Anna?” she asked in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>“Why Mrs. Lorraine, now you speak of it—Alice
does seem—nervous,” the girl admitted.</p>

<p>“She does. Decidedly. I cannot understand it.
She gets wrought up over such trifles. You saw how
it was last night about giving up the cottage? And
to-day she wanted to rush off the minute dinner was
over to look for the key she lost. She seemed all used
up over it. I told her Mr. Clarke very likely had
others, and that anyhow it wasn’t such a serious matter
as she made it to lose a key in a quiet community
like this, but she was too excited to be reasonable.
Finally, I persuaded her to go up and lie down and
put this off until to-morrow, but I feel worn out
myself from the struggle.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think the work she does here is tiring
her?” asked Miss Penny anxiously.</p>

<p>“She did more at the cottage, and besides of late
she hardly does anything,” said Mrs. Lorraine.</p>

<p>“Alice is high-strung and goes into things too intensely,”
remarked Miss Penny. “She took to going
off for long walks when you were away, Anna, and I
think she overdid. I don’t think she went so far as
going to the cemetery as you did; but she seems to
have become interested in old-time things and people—antiquities
and relics—not relicts,—and yet, I don’t
know—there’s Enoch Arden, you know.”</p>

<p>“Enoch Arden!” cried Anna aghast.</p>

<p>Miss Penny smiled. “My dear, my head is all right,—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
good, that is to say, as it ever was. I was simply—but
naturally you didn’t see the point. One night
some time ago—it was, O, a month ago, I should say,
though it might not have been, Alice read Enoch
Arden aloud to her mother and me. We all talked
about it afterwards but Alice couldn’t seem to get
through. She kept questioning me. She wanted to
find out whether it could be true—here, for instance,
right here in this village. She started me to thinking
of the different widows, you know, and whether any
husbands had left Farleigh and never come back.
Reuben’s father wasn’t exactly a husband, you know,
though he went away and never returned. But he was
a widower. And his wife even if she had been alive
would never have married again. And if she had, it
wouldn’t have been Enoch Arden, for he was killed in
a wreck—that’s more certain than being lost at sea.”</p>

<p>“But—Enoch Arden?” asked Anna still perplexed.</p>

<p>“That’s just it. That’s why it took so long to get
through—if we ever got through? Alice would get
me started and then I would be reminded of something
else and lose the point. There are so many
different stories connected with everyone, you see. And
yet, I don’t know that anyone in Farleigh ever had
so many stories that could be told at his age as Reuben
has.”</p>

<p>Anna put the kitten tenderly down on the hearth.</p>

<p>“You’re not going upstairs, Anna?” asked Mrs.
Lorraine.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll run straight home and see my baby,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
returned Anna, who knew well that Alice Lorraine
was not in her room or in the Hollow at all. And she
acted upon her words.</p>

<p>She sighed as she climbed the stair at home to her
own chamber. The problem of Alice seemed too big
for the like of her. But she sighed yet more deeply
when Freddy came up to say that Mr. Langley was
down in the sitting-room. Had something happened?
she asked herself in terror; or was it only that he had
come to ask her if she had spoken to Alice? But no,
he had given her until to-morrow. Looking over the
baby to see that he was immaculate, she picked him up
and went down, not even stopping to glance at the
mirror, though she had been lying on her bed.</p>

<p>“Anna looks almost as much a child as the baby
himself,” Mr. Langley remarked to Mrs. Miller, rising
as the girl entered with little Joe on her arm, his
starched frock standing out over his frilled petticoats,
his mournful, colourless face against her rosy one,
the wisp of hair on top of his head contrasting oddly
with her thick yellow mop of short locks.</p>

<p>“She’s just wearing herself out with that child,
Anna is,” remarked her mother rather fretfully.</p>

<p>“Let me have him, pray Anna,” said the minister
eagerly holding out his arms. The baby went to him
indifferently.</p>

<p>He was equally indifferent to the remainder of the
company that filled the room. Miss Penny and Mrs.
Lorraine had come over to be in time for him when
he waked. All the Millers were there. The boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
always hung round when they felt sure the baby
wouldn’t be left alone for them to mind, and Seth
Miller never liked to leave the house when the child
was awake. But one or many,—it was all a matter of
indifference to little Joe.</p>

<p>Anna was secretly relieved by the presence of Miss
Penny and Mrs. Lorraine. For the minute she saw
Mr. Langley she knew his coming had nothing to do
with Alice. She recollected her visit at the parsonage
the day before and knew as well as if he had announced
it that he had come to bid her reconsider her
decision. But he wouldn’t be likely to ask her before
the others and if he did, it would be easier for her to
refuse. But she sighed within her. She wasn’t sure.
And fancy refusing Mr. Langley anything before Miss
Penny! And she couldn’t explain afterwards even to
Miss Penny that it was all for his ultimate good. That
would be quite too smug!</p>

<p>But he acted as if he had come merely for a social
call. The baby rested in his arms, quiet and sober,
while they talked of indifferent things though not indifferently.
Mr. Langley and Mrs. Miller discussed
the concert at the church last month and Seth Miller
declared that his wife was full of music, and announced,
to the surprise of all, that he planned to get
a piano-forte before very long for her and the girls—Rusty
would enjoy playing on it when she was home
for her holidays.</p>

<p>“O pa, can we play on it?” cried both the boys at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Seth Miller frowned. But before he could speak,
Anna smiled on him.</p>

<p>“I guess they can, if I am in the room with them
until they get used to it and know how to handle it,
can’t they, pa?” she asked. And he assured her that
of course they could.</p>

<p>Meantime one and another tried to relieve Mr.
Langley of his burden, though none was as disinterested
as he seemed. The baby was sober—sad, indeed,
but he was very comfortable to hold. He never
wriggled as many babies do. And plain as he was,
there was something appealing about him. And besides,
there was always the prospect of being the fortunate
one to win his first smile. But Mr. Langley
refused all proffers. He wouldn’t even give him up to
Miss Penny.</p>

<p>“You may have him when I go, Miss Penny,” he
said smiling, “but I want him as long as I stay. You’re
all near neighbours and can see little Joe every day,
but I seldom get a chance. But bless me, what’s the
boy up to now?”</p>

<p>Nothing very exciting, truly. A weak little hand
was fumbling for Mr. Langley’s watch guard, the
baby gazing at the bright trinkets with some interest.
Of course the minister did the usual thing, drew out
his watch and held it to the child’s ear. Joe listened
attentively and apparently wished it to be held there
indefinitely.</p>

<p>Mr. Langley had to return it to his pocket, however,
when he rose to take leave, and it was probably that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
which troubled the baby. But he thought, as he would
have put the child in Miss Penny’s arms, that little
Joe cried for him, and a certain satisfaction was apparent
beneath his concern.</p>

<p>The baby did not cry out. He did not make a
sound. But two tears spilled upon his thin cheeks
and the maternal Anna seized him anxiously. Burying
his face in her shoulder, Joe, Junior, found instant
solace.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you a moment, please, Anna,”
Mr. Langley asked. Anna’s heart sank but she went
out into the passage with him. It was cold there, so
he wouldn’t keep her, and she hoped she could hold
out.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Langley is feeling badly because you said
you couldn’t come to see her next Saturday,” he said
very kindly. “If you are willing to spend the time, I
wonder if we can’t rearrange matters. Why can’t I
come over and mind the baby while you’re gone? He’s
good with me, as you see, and with the watch——”</p>

<p>He was like a boy in his eagerness. Anna paled.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Mr. Langley, only really that
wouldn’t help out. You see ma would feel just the
same. She’d love to have you come, of course, but
she wouldn’t feel as if it was polite to leave you and—you
see if she was right here all the while, there
wouldn’t be any need of your coming way over from
the parsonage. Now would there?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You remind me of what is called in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
logic a vicious circle,” he said. But he became serious
at once.</p>

<p>“I hate to seem to overpersuade you, but, Anna, if
there’s any way in the world you can manage it, I
should be more than grateful to you,” he said earnestly.
“Already, I know, I am under tremendous obligation
to you. You have done more for Mrs. Langley—and
for me—than I can ever begin to thank you for. And
yet I am asking further grace. But perhaps if you
could manage to keep up for a few weeks more, we
can get along afterwards.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes filled with tears. With all the hardship
she had known, she had never learned to be ungracious.
She couldn’t explain that she was holding
out because only so, it seemed to her, could she bring
about the desired end, and that she was acting for his
ultimate good. She couldn’t tell him that she, a
school girl, was treating a grown woman, and the
minister’s wife into the bargain, like a naughty, stubborn
child.</p>

<p>“Really and truly, Mr. Langley, I have thought and
planned and tried to do the best I can. But I can’t
come to the parsonage any more unless I can bring the
baby with me,” she said in a low, desperate voice.</p>

<p>“Well, you know best, Anna,” he said in a tone
whose kindness could not cloak his intense disappointment.
“I am very sorry, and if anything happens that
would enable you to change your mind, I am sure you
will let me know.”</p>

<p>Anna Miller flew to her room and wept. She who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
had endured with all sweetness much that would have
made another bitter, now wept almost bitterly, while
little Joe sat beside her on the bed in solemn silence.
But presently the girl felt a little hand on her head,
uncovered her face and smiled through her tears at
the baby’s first attempt at a caress. And he of his own
accord cuddled down beside her on the pillow with his
cheek against hers.</p>

<p>“You darling love!” the girl cried. “But, O, it’s
<i>my</i> heart you’ll be breaking instead of Mrs. Langley’s.
Here I am with my frame-up to get rid of you, hurting
Mr. Langley and disciplining his wife, when if I
should make a get-away of it, it would simply kill me
dead! And after all, why should I? I have a mind,
honey-sweet, to throw over the whole thing, that ginger-coloured
old woman with the peppery eyes and all,
and let Mr. Langley become a hoary old man as soon
as he has a mind to, and just devote myself to you.
When are you going to talk, precious? Can’t you
say An-na?”</p>

<p>Joe, Junior, remained dumb.</p>

<p>“Well, I am mighty thankful you can’t—or won’t.
For if you could—or would—then I would never in
the world let you go. And really, I <i>must</i> put it
through. You’d be far better off at the parsonage
with the best man in all the world for a daddy, and
with a mother that wouldn’t be half bad if she would
once give in to your blessed charms—as she is going
to do. Besides, you’d belong there, and you don’t
here. Ma doesn’t want you round, and you feel it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
your sensitive little heart and that’s why you act so
queer and offish. But it’ll all come out right—for
everybody but poor me. Cheer up, old sport!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Mr. Langley walked slowly back to Farleigh in
the early dusk of the cloudy November day, he
reflected upon his visit, upon the beautiful baby, upon
what had carried him thither and upon Anna’s unaccountable
unwillingness to gratify his wife’s not unnatural
desire. But he said to himself it wasn’t really
unaccountable—it only seemed so to him. How serious
the girl had looked as she stood with the baby in
her arms, its little face hidden on her shoulder—and
how staunch and true! And when all was said, she
had simply refused to neglect her duty as she saw it.
Quite likely, too, she saw more clearly than he. Certainly
there was nothing selfish in her standpoint,
while he, for his part, could not so absolve himself.
He hoped he had not urged her unduly.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the situation was not normal. Anna’s
mother was rightly troubled. The girl was too young
to shoulder the responsibility she had taken upon herself.
After the strain of those hard years in the city,
she ought to be free to devote herself to school and a
school-girl’s pleasures with only the normal home duties
of such an one. Someone ought to adopt the
baby—someone in Farleigh so that Anna need not be
separated wholly from him. Someone—Mr. Langley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
stopped and put forth considerable effort to dislodge
a stone between the flags with his walking stick. As he
went on again, he said to himself that it would be a
simple matter to put through. If they knew there was
a chance, it seemed to him that people would simply
flock to the Millers’ in crowds to beg for that most
engaging baby. How wise the little fellow had looked
as he listened to the watch!</p>

<p>Sighing vague, he hastened on as if he wished to
escape something. But with all his speed, he was unable
to do so, and depression settled upon him. He
supposed that it was because he was drawing near the
parsonage and would have to disappoint his wife.</p>

<p>He went directly to her room, realising, even in his
preoccupation, that he owed the privilege to Anna. For
only since she had entered the wedge, had he fallen
into the habit of seeking his wife at odd moments.
And though she rather tolerated than welcomed his
visits, he was grateful for even tolerance. For her
long illness and silence and desire for seclusion had
estranged husband and wife almost as effectually as
bitter feeling might have done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley sat in her cushioned chair in the dark,
gloomy room, awaiting the word he was to bring.
Her eyes were weak from headache and want of sunshine
and out-of-door air, and in winter she had her
tea very early to avoid lighting the heavily shaded
lamp. Both Mr. Langley and Bell Adams felt that,
having admitted Anna Miller, if Mrs. Langley would
also let in the sunshine she might utterly banish neuralgia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
But neither ventured to make the suggestion.
She had already had her tea, and when he entered the
room, her husband felt rather than saw her eager
questioning gaze.</p>

<p>“Anna still feels that she cannot get away without
the baby, Ella dear,” he said gently, seating himself
on the edge of a chair, like a poor relation in a fine
drawing room. “And really, I see her difficulty. As
a matter of fact, the girl has added one member—a
complete stranger with no claim whatever—to a rather
straitened household and she doesn’t wish her mother
to feel the burden unduly. And certainly Mrs. Miller
had a difficult time when her children were small
and——”</p>

<p>His wife broke in almost fiercely.</p>

<p>“Russell Langley! I tell you that I cannot get along
without seeing Anna at least every Saturday,” she
cried.</p>

<p>He sighed as he pushed back a bit further on the
chair, though not enough to be comfortable.</p>

<p>“Well, Ella, why not let her bring him along—why
not try it just for once?” he asked quietly. “He’s
really a beautiful child. (The minister was quite sincere.)
He sat on my lap all the while I was there,
quiet as a mouse, and the first I knew the little fellow
was feeling for my watch. I only wish you could
have seen his face, dear, as I held it to his ear. Do
let Anna bring him on Saturday!”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t bear the shock of it,” she said dully as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
if repeating a formula, then suddenly enquired: “Russell,
where’s my watch?”</p>

<p>“In the top drawer of my desk. I wind it every
night. Would you like it, Ella?”</p>

<p>She assented rather sharply and he fetched it. Now
he seated himself comfortably and taking the key from
his chain, wound the watch and set it exactly by his
own and put it on the stand with the medicine bottles
and the photograph of the lamb.</p>

<p>“She’s a stubborn girl, that Anna Miller,” his wife
remarked.</p>

<p>“She means well,” he returned absently in conventional
phrase, his mind being otherwise engaged as he
presently showed.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he exclaimed suddenly, holding his watch
from him as if he had discovered the clue to the mystery
in it. “Anna can bring the baby with her, but
you needn’t see him—you needn’t realise that he’s in
the house at all; and you wouldn’t, he’s such a mouse.
And I’ll mind him while Anna visits you. He knows
me—I think he rather takes to me, you know, and I
can carry him all over the house and show him everything.
I fancy the little chap might rather like the
statuette on the parlour clock and—O, the elves on the
silver water-pitcher! And there’s my crystal paper
weight. And perhaps when I’m over in Wenham I
will just step into Wetherell’s and see what they have
in the way of toys. Boys generally——”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Langley made a sudden move.</p>

<p>“Russell Langley!” she cried. “If that baby comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to this house, he shall come straight to my room. He
can have my watch to play with. He can’t hurt it, and
if he bites the case, I don’t care.”</p>

<p>Seth Miller was one of the folk who adored Mr.
Langley and he was aware of the disappointed look
upon his face as he left the house that Sunday afternoon.
He had unbounded confidence in his daughter;
if she caused the disappointment, it was because she
couldn’t help it. But he felt as if he should like to do
something particularly nice for the minister to make
up for it.</p>

<p>As he pondered upon it, it came to him that he
might be able to do some bit of carpentry at the
church as a surprise to Mr. Langley. But he couldn’t
think of anything that was necessary, and to discover
any possibility in the way of ornamentation he would
have to go over to the church. He had gone over
early that morning to see to the fire, had attended
service, waiting until everyone was out after Sunday
school to lock the building, and he would have to go
over early to unlock the building and see that all was
right for evening service. He might have postponed
this matter until that time, but it seemed to make it of
more consequence if he made a special journey, so he
decided to go at once.</p>

<p>He was tired enough, however, not to wish to go
upstairs for his keys. He had an extra key to the
little side door leading to the vestry which he kept in
the kitchen so that Anna could get it when he was
away. She had sung in the choir before the baby’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
arrival and had let the others in and out for rehearsals.
But when he looked, the key was not in its place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller and the boys had gone home with Miss
Penny and Anna was in her room, so he fetched his
bunch of keys and went on, wondering that Anna, who
was exceedingly careful of such things, should have
failed to return the key to the nail where it belonged.
As he approached the church from the rear he was suddenly
startled by a sound which was, however, not startling
in itself—a low, sweet strain of music which
seemed to come from the church and to be the voice of
the well-known organ.</p>

<p>Seth Miller’s heart beat violently. The organist
came from Wenham and did not play for evening
service. Moreover, she played at Wenham in the
afternoon—she was in the church there at this very
moment. No one else but Mr. Langley had a key and
he did not play the big organ. And—how early the
sun set. It was almost dark now. Miller did not
believe in ghosts, but—it would be dark inside.</p>

<p>The music ceased. As it died away, it came to
him that Anna might be in the church. Perhaps
the baby had fallen asleep and she had run down for
a little change. He didn’t know that she could play
the pipe organ, but she was full of music like her
mother. Moreover, he wasn’t sure as the music he
had heard had been correct music. He had something
of an ear himself, but the strain was low and he had
been excited, and for all he knew, it might have been
the chromatic scale. Of course it was Anna, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
hurried round to the door of which she had the key.</p>

<p>But it was fast. He had told Anna not to lock the
door behind her at choir rehearsal, but perhaps she
felt that this was different. He unlocked it and went
in making a racket and calling her name lest she be
frightened.</p>

<p>She was not to be found, however. The audience
room looked exactly as it had when he had left it early
in the afternoon except that now twilight had fallen
upon it. He went to the organ loft, but saw no traces
of anyone having been there. And he began to wonder
if he had been mistaken. Perhaps he hadn’t heard
anything. But he knew he had. Perhaps it had come
from elsewhere? It had sounded like the organ, but
it was rather low and soft for that great organ. Still,
where could it have come from? Shaking his head,
Seth Miller returned home, his errand forgotten.</p>

<p>That evening as he was about to start for the church,
he asked Anna what she had done with the key to
the vestry door.</p>

<p>“It’s there on the nail, Pa,” she said, pointing to the
place where it should have been—and where it was!</p>

<p>Too confounded for speech, he took it down, handled
and put it back. Then he went out without a
word.</p>

<p>He decided to say nothing to Anna until next day.
But the next day brought wild excitement to the house
in the form of an invitation for Anna to bring little
Joe to the parsonage on Saturday, and he forgot the
lesser in the greater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>The excitement was great, too, at Miss Penny’s, and
Joe, Junior, acquired a new importance. Anna consulted
Mrs. Lorraine and Miss Penny, and even Mrs.
Miller showed an interest in the baby’s toilette for the
occasion. But no one guessed how painfully the girl
made her preparations, for she expected to return
without the child. She sang as she flew about, and
laughed at the boys who were working hard in all
their spare time to teach the baby to talk before he
should visit the parsonage. Freddy began with <i>cat</i>
and <i>rat</i>, those being the words he first learned to read.
Frank, the older and wiser, experimented with bow-wow,
moo-moo and other onomatopoetic syllables, but
with equal unsuccess. The baby wouldn’t even say <i>O</i>.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon, Seth Miller himself drove
them over to the parsonage, Miss Penny having loaned
her pony. Mr. Langley came to the gate and proudly
and rather spectacularly bore the baby into the house
as if it were a royal infant. He removed his little
bonnet and cloak with surprising deftness, admiring
the swan’s down border of the hood as if it were
ermine. Big Bell stood at the end of the passage with
a wistful expression on her homely face and Anna
tiptoed past Mrs. Langley’s door to let her see the
baby first.</p>

<p>But the emotion displayed by the giantess gave the
girl pause. On the threshold of Mrs. Langley’s room
she was seized with sudden apprehension. Suppose it
should be too much for the invalid! Her reiterated
phrase as to its breaking her heart to see the baby acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
a warning significance. On a sudden Anna
wished with all her heart that she hadn’t insisted.
Suppose the shock were too much for Mrs. Langley!</p>

<p>“We’re here,” she said faintly, ready to back out
across the threshold at a word.</p>

<p>“Come up near,” Mrs. Langley bade her more
hoarsely than usual and not at all reassuringly. She
obeyed tremblingly.</p>

<p>Taking the customary chair, she settled the baby
comfortably and fixed her eyes upon his wisp of hair.
If she hadn’t heard her heart beating wildly she
wouldn’t have believed that she breathed at all.</p>

<p>For a few moments Mrs. Langley peered at the
child in silence. He was beautifully dressed, but he
wasn’t at all what she had expected from Anna’s and
her husband’s accounts. He wasn’t even what a baby
would naturally have been expected to be apart from
pardonable exaggeration. He wasn’t round nor rosy
nor pretty; he looked like nothing so much as a very
ugly rubber doll dressed in fine raiment. Moreover,
Ella Langley had so dreaded the ordeal that cold sweat
stood upon her forehead in beads.</p>

<p>None the less, as she gazed, her heart warmed.
There was, somehow, something appealing in his big,
mournful eyes and plaintive little white, pinched face
and perhaps even in the very want of baby charms.
The woman hadn’t seen a child for years upon years
and suddenly her heart yearned towards this one overwhelmingly.</p>

<p>“O Anna, let me take him in my arms,” she entreated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
in a voice Anna had never heard before. Surprised
and delighted, and without for the moment
considering the significance of it, the girl rose quickly
to put the baby into the outstretched arms.</p>

<p>But for the first time Joe, Junior, who went mournfully
wherever he was placed, indifferent to all but
Anna, resisted—resisted convulsively. Springing
back with a strength he had not seemed to possess, he
clung to Anna with a grasp that was painful in its
intensity. Then as Mrs. Langley’s hand fell gently
upon his shoulder, he uttered a piercing cry—such a
shriek as had never before echoed within the parsonage
walls. His arms tight about Anna’s neck, clutching
like a frightened wild animal, Joe, Junior, continued
to shriek and without pause.</p>

<p>Never before since Anna had known him had the
baby uttered a sound above a mere whimper. The
girl’s blood congealed for terror. As he continued
to scream in a manner that seemed to stop her heart
and paralyze her muscles, she stood motionless for a
few seconds. Recovering herself, she fled wildly from
the room.</p>

<p>She never knew when the baby stopped screaming.
Snatching his wraps, in some manner she got him
into them, and careless of her own, rushed out of the
house and through the gate, flying along the village
street in the direction of the Hollow and home.
And before the minister, who was in the garret, happily
occupied in searching for toys or something that
might take the place of toys, had located the strange
sound or realised what it meant, Anna Miller and Joe,
Junior, were out of sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. LANGLEY, Mrs. Lorraine and Seth Miller
had been severally perturbed at about the same
period over a matter which might or might not have
had a common occasion. But the excitement of the
following week centering about little Joe quite drove
other affairs from the minds of the first and last mentioned
and caused even Mrs. Lorraine’s anxiety over
her daughter to be relieved because of the constant
demand upon her attention and sympathies. She enquired
for the lost key early in the week, and Alice
quietly gave it into her hands. As she took it, it
seemed as if she remembered another, and that the
two were on a ring or tag; but she forebore to question.
Neither did she bring up the matter of giving
up the cottage. After all, they had made no definite
decision and might as well keep the house until after
Christmas. She wasn’t sure, if Alice remained in this
strange and difficult condition, that they ought to
remain longer with Miss Penny. But she said nothing
of this nor of anything to Alice, hoping that the girl
would come to her. But Alice, though she was less
nervous and was not out so late, kept her own counsel
and her habit of solitary rambles.</p>

<p>But one night when they sat at tea, Miss Penny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
suddenly turned to Alice and asked if she had found
the key. Alice assented, changing the subject so
quickly that her mother was vexed.</p>

<p>“That reminds me, Alice, I thought there were two
keys when they were given to us,” she said.</p>

<p>“I believe there were. The other is down there. You
don’t want both, mother?”</p>

<p>“O, were they duplicates, Alice?” her mother asked,
for she had thought they might have opened different
doors.</p>

<p>“One was for a shed or something,” returned Alice
carelessly, and turning to Miss Penny made a lame
remark about the shape of the cream jug which she
had admired before.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you—one must have been the key to the
shop!” cried Miss Penny. “You see there was a shop
with the old house that was torn down—nearly every
house had them once. This one is a tidy little place,
or was. Reuben’s father used to work there a great
deal—I don’t know whether it was over his music—of
course there was no instrument, but when you think
of Wagner—or whoever it was that couldn’t hear a
sound—though I am not sure that his wife—Reuben’s
mother—didn’t have an old melodeon besides the organ
they had in the cottage—not the pipe organ. They
never got that. But he made things, too. He made
tables and chairs and—what-nots, I rather think—though
he hadn’t a great deal of time for he worked
over to Wenham besides playing the church organ.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Such hands as that man had—and Reuben’s are just
like them.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, I shouldn’t have said there was a separate
building on the place,” remarked Mrs. Lorraine,
“should you, Alice?”</p>

<p>“No mother, I shouldn’t have,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“There’s such a tangle of brush and I believe the
land drops just there, which I suppose helps hide it,”
Mrs. Lorraine went on. “I’d rather like to see that
shop. I believe I’ll go down some afternoon and look
it over. Perhaps I can go this week. O Miss Penny,
how would you feel about going with me?”</p>

<p>“I would—why, Alice!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine, seeing that her daughter was very
pale and looked as if she were about to faint, rose and
went to her. “Are you ill, Alice?” she cried anxiously,
holding a goblet of water to her lips.</p>

<p>“No, no, mother. It’s nothing. Please sit down
again. I had a—sort of pain, that’s all,” the girl
declared.</p>

<p>She wouldn’t lie down and even made a pretence of
eating her supper. Her colour came back and as she
seemed all right next day her mother was not troubled.
Indeed, as the week passed, she felt less anxious than
she had for some time, for Alice seemed more like
her old self again. She hardly went out at all except
to the Millers’ or with Anna. And on Sunday, to her
mother’s surprise and delight, she remained in all
afternoon.</p>

<p>A storm had been imminent all day and snow began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
to fall just as the first bell rang for evening service.
Ten minutes after the second bell had ceased ringing,
Alice stole down the back stairs in tam o’ shanter and
ulster and would have slipped out but that her mother
saw her and stopped her at the door.</p>

<p>“Alice, you’re not going out?” she said, though the
girl’s purpose was evident.</p>

<p>“I am going to Farleigh to drop this letter in the
post office, mother.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear child, it isn’t open on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“There’s a place on the outside where you can drop
letters in,” declared the girl.</p>

<p>“What a pity you didn’t send it by Mr. Miller! Don’t
you know, Alice, that he always goes down for evening
service?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to send it by him.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, is it a very important letter, Alice?”</p>

<p>“It’s a letter to father!” cried the girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine paled. “I am glad you wrote your
father, dear, and—it’s all right if you wish to post it
yourself. Wait a minute and I will go with you.”</p>

<p>“O mother, you mustn’t leave Miss Penny!” Alice
declared; then, as steps sounded at that moment on
the porch: “O, someone’s coming. Let me get away.”
And she slipped quickly out.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards Seth Miller arrived with his
lantern which he turned down to a proper height and
left in the porch. Miller was earning a good income
as janitor of the schools in the South Hollow, including,
of course, the academy, and as sexton of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
church, besides having all the carpentry he could do
during the school vacation. He had moved his family
into a warm, comfortable house and was the head or
at least the source of supply of a comfortable, well-dressed,
happy household. Despite his anxiety, he
could not but feel himself to be a substantial citizen
and freeholder as he went forth over the new-fallen
snow to consult with his neighbours.</p>

<p>Miss Penny asked anxiously for the baby. He replied
that little Joe was prime but that Anna had felt
wretchedly all day and was really ill to-night. While
her mother was getting her to bed he had come over
to see if they had any suggestions.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is, we can’t consult Mr. Langley,”
said Miss Penny in her fluttered way. “He always
knows just what to do, but—there’s his wife, you see.
What I mean is—of course, I am as pleased as anyone—and
that alone wouldn’t hurt Anna—nor perhaps
the other alone—I am not sure—but racing home to
little Joe—and all her school work—and standing all
day when she was clerking in the city. And as you
say, Seth, it was unfortunate, his crying the first time.
But we mustn’t blame the little fellow. Anna says
she looks like Red Riding-Hood’s grandmother—no,
I believe it was like the wolf dressed up in the grandmother’s
night gown, though I don’t suppose he’s heard
that story or would understand it if he had.”</p>

<p>“No’m, you’re right. Not yet, Miss Penny,” Miller
assured her politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“What does Anna’s mother think?” asked Mrs. Lorraine.</p>

<p>“Jenny lays it all to the baby, mostly. She never
took to him as the rest of us do, Mrs. Lorraine, and
she frets more ’n I ever knew her to over Anna’s
having the care of him. And all the time, you know,
he ain’t much trouble.”</p>

<p>“We might take him over here for a while, Mrs.
Lorraine?” Miss Penny suggested.</p>

<p>“You’d only shift the trouble, Miss Penny,” Miller
declared. “Anna’d come along, too, and you’d be all
wore out with the excitement and Jenny would be all
the more worried. She thinks, too, Anna hadn’t ought
to go to Mrs. Langley’s so often.”</p>

<p>“After all, why should she go at all?” demanded
Mrs. Lorraine with sudden spirit. “Why don’t you
put your foot down, Mr. Miller, that she sha’n’t go
there except in vacation?”</p>

<p>Seth Miller was flattered by the implication of her
demand. But he knew as well as any that he wasn’t
one to set his foot down in any firm way in his own
family.</p>

<p>“I guess I couldn’t hardly do that, Mrs. Lorraine,
for Anna might take it to heart,” he said. “And you
see we was without our daughter for five years.”</p>

<p>“And consider what it means to Mr. Langley to
have her go!” cried Miss Penny. “O Mrs. Lorraine,
if you could know what store we set by that man—though
I suppose you begin to guess by now. But
you may not know how we all long to do something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
for him—to show our appreciation—or perhaps to satisfy
our own hearts—and it’s so difficult—it’s next to
impossible. And she his wife, you know. If she
should come out among people, he would be the happiest
man alive.”</p>

<p>“I fear she never will, Miss Penny,” Mrs. Lorraine
returned doubtfully. “She has been shut in too long.
People like that grow selfish and exacting. She will
never be willing to make the effort it would require
to receive other people so long as she can have Anna,
who just suits her. She’ll cling to her and I fear will
devour her youth.”</p>

<p>The phrase impressed Seth Miller deeply. He repeated
it more than once as he walked across with his
lantern, sighing deeply with each repetition, though
he had really been cheered by the promise the ladies
had given him to consider the problem carefully.</p>

<p>He was amazed to find Anna, wrapped in a woollen
dressing-gown, sitting by the kitchen stove with her
mother and the boys. She had regained her colour
and seemed herself again. As she shook back her short
yellow locks, her father thought she looked like a posy
swayed by the wind.</p>

<p>“O pa, what do you think! Here’s a note from Mrs.
Langley!” she cried. “I thought she’d be so mad
after yesterday that she’d never want to see me again,
but here she is begging to see me soon because she has
something special to speak about. Mr. Langley will
come for me and bring me back, she says, if I’ll come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
some night after school. Here it is—sort of funny
writing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>As it never occurred to the other Miller girl to wait
until she was stronger, she hurried over to the parsonage
Monday afternoon. And her heart leaped with
generous emotion when Mrs. Langley’s first question
was for the baby.</p>

<p>“Joe’s right as rain, bless his heart, Mrs. Langley,”
she returned cheerfully. “Pa says it did him good to
expand his lungs. You understand how it was, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley evaded the question by asking another:
“Who’s with him now?”</p>

<p>“Ma’s right there and the boys are minding him.
You see,—I—I wanted to bring him with me so badly
that I’m afraid I didn’t try as I might have to get him
taken care of. And anyhow the boys are getting better.
What do you suppose? They took the pennies
they have been saving for Christmas and sent over to
Wenham by Walter Phelps and got him a perfectly
scrumptious linen picture book with an animal for
every blooming letter of the alphabet. They’re perfectly
dotty over teaching him to talk. Freddy thinks
it will be easier now that he knows how to cry!”</p>

<p>“O, the baby isn’t afraid of them?”</p>

<p>“O no, the baby isn’t afraid of anybody,” returned
Anna before she had time to reflect. Then she flushed.
“I mean he isn’t afraid of anyone he’s used to. Of
course he’s used to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Then he’d get used to me?” Mrs. Langley half-asserted,
half-questioned. Anna’s heart sank.</p>

<p>“I guess Joe, Junior’d better not go so far from
home again until he’s older,” she said gently. “I ought
to have known better. But I can come just the same.
The boys have already offered to mind him Saturday.”</p>

<p>“But I want to see <i>him</i> again,” Mrs. Langley insisted.
And Anna felt as if she were standing on her
head, to have Mrs. Langley begging to see the baby
and to be trying to hold her off.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Mrs. Langley, when he’s a wee bit
older,” she temporized, but the other broke in impatiently.
“Anna Miller! it’s just because he’s a baby
that I want to see him. When he’s older, I sha’n’t
care.”</p>

<p>Anna sighed.</p>

<p>“He’ll get used to me,” Mrs. Langley urged. “I
understand that he lets Mr. Langley hold him?”</p>

<p>“O, any child would go to Mr. Langley, he’s so
good and so——”</p>

<p>“So <i>what</i>?” demanded the minister’s wife, so fiercely
that Anna faltered the word she had meant to swallow:
<i>handsome</i>.</p>

<p>“Anna Miller! Do you mean to tell me that I—that
I frightened that baby by my looks?” cried the
invalid yet more fiercely.</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to look like anyone he’s happened
to see so far, nor—dress like ’em,” Anna murmured
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“You’d hardly expect him ever to see anyone who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
had suffered as I have all these years and lost everyone
they ever cared for!”</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Langley,” Anna reminded her.</p>

<p>“Of course. But he isn’t like one’s own child.
Anna, will you go out and send Bell in to me. Then
please wait until she comes for you.”</p>

<p>Too sore and shocked to protest, Anna complied
silently. She guessed that Mrs. Langley was about to
consult a mirror. If she hadn’t seen herself since—since
the little lamb had been placed in the cemetery,
she would—but Anna’s imagination refused to compass
the situation. She waited with mingled dread
and terror for—she knew not what.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BIG BELL’S voice was actually soft as she bade
Anna return to her mistress, and the girl stole
fearfully in. However, nothing dire had happened.
Except that she was strangely subdued, Mrs. Langley
was her usual self. But Anna’s heart ached sadly.</p>

<p>She chattered lightly about the snow-fall and the
interrupted skating. Mrs. Langley, who hadn’t listened,
presently broke in.</p>

<p>“Anna, what can I do to make—so that the baby
won’t be afraid of me?” she asked at once meekly and
fiercely so that Anna shuddered. There was no answer
to that riddle, but she plucked up a bit of spirit.</p>

<p>“It was partly the dark—the half dark, I mean.
Junior’s used to one thing or t’other. There’s no twilight
in our house any more than there was where he
came from,” she said, rather talking against time than
making a suggestion. But the other took it as such.</p>

<p>“It would hurt my eyes, but I could have the blinds
raised. Would he be all right then?”</p>

<p>Anna couldn’t say that he would. She looked at
Mrs. Langley pleadingly.</p>

<p>“You think he would still be afraid of me?”</p>

<p>“Why, he might be afraid of—the memory of you,”
the girl said reluctantly. “If you looked like—the lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
he saw in the dark room that made him cry, he might,
I suppose——”</p>

<p>But the girl stopped short. No, he mightn’t. Not
for all the world would she subject that baby to the
danger of a second fright.</p>

<p>“You think I ought to wear something light and
pretty?” Mrs. Langley asked almost humbly.</p>

<p>“It would be nice if you should,” Anna returned in
noncommittal fashion. “But if you did, you would
have to fix your hair in some other way. Having it
drawn back so tight wouldn’t go with a nifty dress.
Perhaps you could have it a bit looser about your
face?”</p>

<p>Anna didn’t know what possessed her. She had
almost said <i>phiz</i>. And something within her added
that <i>mug</i> wouldn’t be bad. As she thought of a dainty,
light gown and soft hair about that ugly yellow face,
she had an hysterical impulse to laugh or to burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’d like it frizzed?” suggested Mrs.
Langley. And then Anna laughed out naturally.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Langley, one would think Joe, Junior, was
royalty!” she exclaimed. And then she wanted to cry.
<i>Frizzes</i> about that face!</p>

<p>“You’re not well enough anyhow to bother about
curl papers. Soft and loose would be just as well,”
she murmured with a deepening sense of guilt. She
had grown so used to Mrs. Langley that she had forgotten
her ugliness until Saturday had impressed it
forcibly upon her. She said to herself it was wicked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
to talk against time as she was. Could that harsh-looking
hair ever look smooth? And anyhow, she
knew she would never venture to bring the baby hither
again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley was staring at her. “I suppose he
likes your hair, Anna?” she asked with something
like craving in her voice.</p>

<p>“Rather. He’s stuck on anything yellow. He
clutches at the sunshine and he reached for Mr. Langley’s
watch.”</p>

<p>“If I will have Bell put the blinds up as far as they
will go, will you bring him again on Saturday afternoon,
Anna?” Mrs. Langley asked almost eagerly, and
added, “You’ll have to come early to catch the sunshine,
for there isn’t any after the middle of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“O but Mrs. Langley, you could never stand the
strong sunlight all at once. Your poor eyes! You
must let it in little by little!” protested the girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley looked hard at her. “Anna Miller!
You have made up your mind you won’t bring him,”
she declared.</p>

<p>“I don’t want him to cry again. Neither do you;
so it’s partly for your sake,” Anna declared.</p>

<p>“But you said he wouldn’t cry if I did all that?”</p>

<p>Anna remained silent.</p>

<p>“You did say so?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly that. I’m awfully sorry, but I’m afraid
that even after all that it wouldn’t go.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“I really can’t tell. I’m not sure that I know. But
I will come myself just the same.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley sat almost erect. When it had happened,
Anna did not know, but she noticed now for the
first time that the hump was gone. “I don’t want you
without him,” she cried, “and I want to know the
truth. Why should he be afraid of me after I had
done all that?”</p>

<p>“Because—O, if everything else was all right, he
would be afraid of—your teeth!” the girl cried desperately.
“They’re so—far apart—there’s a gap on
each side. He hasn’t many, himself, but they’re close
up and anyhow he doesn’t know what he looks like.
When I hold him up to the mirror, what do you think
he does. He looks right at me!” And the girl laughed
nervously.</p>

<p>It was all she could do to restrain her tears. It
seemed to her as if she could not endure it for another
minute. But when Mrs. Langley spoke she forgot
herself in the great wave of pity that flooded her
heart.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose if it’s that, there’s no help for it,
and I may as well give up,” the woman said in an old,
weary voice. “You feel quite sure, Anna?”</p>

<p>“You could have some put in?” Anna suggested
colourlessly. Then as she went on, her voice showed
the confidence she gained. “You’d be a lot more comfortable,
too. The dentist would come over from
Wenham, you know. He came way over to the Hollow
to draw a tooth for Miss Penny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>For a few moments there was silence. The room
was dark now. Anna moved, and Mrs. Langley spoke
fretfully.</p>

<p>“And you would have me go through all that for a
baby, Anna Miller?”</p>

<p>“Never. Never in the world. Only—you might do
it for other reasons. Mr. Langley might like it,”
Anna suggested timidly.</p>

<p>His wife was apparently surprised, perhaps startled.
As she hadn’t thought of Mr. Langley’s being handsome
until Anna recalled it to her mind, so it would
not have occurred to her that her personal appearance
could be of moment to him.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you surprise him?” the girl suggested
eagerly. “Pretend you want a tooth pulled or—why
need he know about it at all until it’s done? He’s out
so much it would be dead easy.”</p>

<p>“The excitement would kill me,” remarked Mrs.
Langley.</p>

<p>“Then I shouldn’t think about it,” said Anna quite
as decidedly. “After all, lots of women look older
than their husbands. Ma doesn’t, but Mrs. Mudge
does and Mrs. Graham—Mabel’s mother—and—no
end of others.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley had nothing to say but her silence
seemed eloquent—fiercely eloquent to Anna, and she
took leave hastily, promising to drop in again on Saturday.
As she hurried home, she said to herself it
was just as if she had sat in a dentist’s chair all afternoon
and ached all over now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>That night as she lay in bed, she said to herself that
that was the end of everything. And she feared that
she was more relieved than disappointed. It would be
cruelly hard to part with the baby and her heart leaped
at the thought of keeping him always. And she
owned to her innermost heart that she should be glad
of a rest from going to the parsonage. She would
have more time for Joe, Junior, and for Alice. She
and Alice could enjoy him together, and—dear me,
she had quite forgotten those absurd rumours about
Alice! She must do something at once.</p>

<p>She was sincerely sorry so far as Mr. Langley was
concerned. But she had done her level best. She
would have given him the baby though it had half
killed her, but she had failed to ‘put it over’. She
must always be sorry for that part of it, for most
likely he would grow old with a vengeance now and
she would be obliged to sit by and watch him going
headlong down hill. Well, and she was sorry for Mrs.
Langley, too. Somehow, she seemed to have a certain
affection for her—a queer, maternal sort of affection
as if a downy yellow chick wanted to mother and
brood an ugly old hen. If only someone had taken
her earlier!</p>

<p>The next day was a day of profound discomfort.
But on Wednesday, a note was brought to the Hollow
from the parsonage asking Anna to come to see Mrs.
Langley on Saturday week at two o’clock and bring
the baby with her. Consternation seized upon her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
settled into despair. But she felt constrained, and
before night sent back word that they would come.</p>

<p>At first she was thankful for the ten days respite.
Then she felt the suspense would kill her. But very
shortly she had no time to worry over that or anything
else except after she got into bed at night and
then she was too tired. For suddenly Alice Lorraine
began to seek and claim her companionship as she had
never done before, and the girls became practically
inseparable.</p>

<p>Anna always enjoyed Alice, and with Alice and Joe
together would have been blissfully happy but for the
lurking apprehension with regard to the Saturday
facing her. And when she forgot that, it was because
she recollected the mystery connected with Alice, who
had ceased her wandering and seemed to her mother
and Miss Penny to be herself again. But Anna knew
better: she wasn’t at all the same girl she had been
before the day Anna had found her at the dark cottage
in the lane. She had moments of high spirits, but
they did not last. She clung to Anna, but she was
still nervous and absent-minded. Anna was forced to
guess that the reason she no longer went back and
forth between the Hollow and the lane was because
the person she met there or the occasion of her going
was no longer thereabout. But although Alice was
not happy nor at her ease, neither was she really unhappy
as she must have been had it—whatever it had
been—been over and the parting final.</p>

<p>If the strange man she had walked with were her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
father, then Anna had no fear. If he had escaped
from prison and his daughter had helped him, Anna
was only too glad. She would have been glad to help
him herself. But if it weren’t—and how could it be?
Why should Alice have exhibited that uncanny interest
in Reuben’s past if the man was her father? If he
wasn’t her father, if he were some younger man—Anna
wouldn’t admit it even to herself, but something
kept trying to tell her that Alice acted now just as a
girl would who was planning to run away—to elope.
Still, that did not explain her interest in Reuben.
Alice didn’t question any more, it is true, but she was
all eagerness whenever Reuben was mentioned. But
nothing could be more absurd, if one knew Reuben,
than to connect him in any way with the man with
whom Alice had been seen or with the occasion of her
solitary rambles.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, happily for Anna, a counter-excitement
arose. A change came over Joe, Junior,
which, slight as it might have seemed to another,
thrilled the heart of his foster-mother. On a sudden
he began to take an interest in the world about him
and the passing scene. A faint flicker of colour
appeared upon his little old man’s face which looked
less mournful and forlorn. He held everything that
was put into his hands, examining it gravely from
every angle, and evinced a real interest in the animals
in his gay picture book, viewing them as seriously and
intently as if he were making weighty deductions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
natural history or even biology, though his silence
remained unbroken.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The December day fixed for the visit at the parsonage
dawned clear and fine and remained unclouded
up to sundown. Anna set out promptly in order to
catch the mid-day beams upon those western windows
that had shut out the sun for so many annual revolutions.
The snow had disappeared, save in patches
facing the north, and the air was genial. Joe, Junior,
was almost rosy, looked calmly content and less serious
than his wont. Anna wore her Sunday suit of hunter’s
green with the coquettish little cocked hat perched
on her short locks and looked like a handsome young
prince. Strange to say, however, she was quite unaware
of her appearance. She hadn’t glanced at a
mirror except to put in her brooch, and her face was
very grave. None knew how the girl dreaded the
ordeal, but Mrs. Lorraine, who drove her over with
the fat pony, guessed something.</p>

<p>She exclaimed over the baby’s improvement, praised
the green suit and thought the little hat was even
more becoming with bobbed hair. Anna smiled absently
but sighed almost immediately.</p>

<p>“Anna, you don’t feel like going this afternoon?
Let me take you back home and then go over to the
parsonage and make your excuses?” Mrs. Lorraine
begged.</p>

<p>“O no, Mrs. Lorraine. I’m really wild to go—in a
way,” Anna declared. “I’m sure everything’s going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
to be all right to-day, only—I seem to be pulled all
ways at once. You see—well,—Freddy came to me
this morning in tears and said he heard ma advising
pa not to buy a piano-forte—not to put his money
into it. She said with an extra mouth to feed he’d
better hold on to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps there isn’t any special hurry about
the piano,” Mrs. Lorraine returned, not venturing to
express at this time the sympathy she felt. And she
endeavoured to distract Anna’s attention by speaking
of the butter she and Miss Penny had made that week,
the market price and the new mould. And Anna forgot
her own perplexities and was quite herself when
they reached the parsonage.</p>

<p>It was Bell Adams who met her at the door to-day.
The expression on her face was such as to puzzle
Anna and rather to frighten her. She spoke in hoarse
whispers and made strange grimaces, and suddenly
Anna’s heart failed her. But she had promised. Slipping
off the baby’s wraps hastily, she took him and hurried
to the door of Mrs. Langley’s room without stopping
to remove her own jacket. She opened the door
desperately. Just within, she paused. She expected
a change, but—what had happened?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE blinds were raised high and the sun streamed
in over so brilliant a Brussels carpet that the
carefully cherished one in Miss Penny’s parlour would
have seemed almost dingy beside it. And the dimness
having vanished, the room seemed to have expanded—to
have thrust out its boundary walls in all directions.
Extra furniture had been moved in—though not, probably,
on that account—which imparted an hospitable if
rather grotesquely amusing air. There were chairs of
all shapes and sizes, tables and stands, hassocks, an
extra what-not, an Indian cabinet, and such an array
of tidies, antimacassars, lambrequins, and afghans as
only a country parsonage can collect through various
periods and many years of ‘fancy-work.’ One of the
larger of the extra tables held the parlour clock, which
was surmounted by a bronze statuette representing a
barefooted maiden with a pitcher, and the other, the
great silver water-pitcher with elves clambering over
the handle which had been the wedding gift from
the church. The medicine bottles had been cleared
away and the stand that had held them was adorned
only by the framed photograph of little Ella May’s
monument resting on a gay mat of shaded red
worsteds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Nevertheless it was not this transformation which
the other Miller girl noticed first, nor was it considerable
in comparison with the real transformation.
After a vague, momentary realisation of the sunshine
and the gorgeous purple and crimson roses of the
border of the carpet, the girl was lost in wonder as
she stared incredulously at the figure in the familiar
yet strange arm chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley—if it were, indeed, Mrs. Langley?—wore
a gown of warm grey shading into lilac with a
lace fichu fastened by a large, handsome cameo brooch.
Her parted hair was brought back so loosely as considerably
to disguise the sharpness of her temples.
Her eyes looked softer and her skin less sallow even
in the strong light; while, most remarkable of all, the
appalling hollows in her cheeks had disappeared, taking
with them almost all the grimness of the mouth. And
when she actually smiled, partly with her eyes yet also
with her lips, Anna lost her head. She forgot all the
neat, deprecatory little speeches she had prepared for
every emergency save this overwhelming surprise.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Langley! you look simply <i>swell</i>!” she
cried, dropping into a three-cornered chair that might
have seemed perilously near. “And here’s little Joe,
Junior, come way across the city from the Hollow to
the Bowery to tell you he’s going to celebrate his first
Christmas in ten days.”</p>

<p>She held her breath. But the baby surveyed the
scene calmly with that new keenness of observation
of his. Apparently nothing suggested to him that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
was the same wherein he had been so terrified a fortnight
since. He stared coolly at the lady in the flowered
chair, the lotos blossoms and birds of paradise
of which hadn’t been visible in the darkened room,
scrutinizing her gravely but without either recognition
or disapproval.</p>

<p>None the less, it was only with a tremendous effort
of will that Anna rose and deliberately put the child
into Mrs. Langley’s arms. For a moment her heart
stood still. But to-day there was no scream. Little
Joe did not even seek to come back to Anna. His
gravity seemed, indeed, rather to lift than to deepen.
He cuddled down in the stranger’s arms in a manner
that implied an absent-minded desire to be comfortable
while he completed his survey. For he made haste
to study the bright colours of the worsted mat. Thence
his gaze roved to the photograph in the frame. He
looked at it hard, glanced at the lady who held him
then turned to Anna.</p>

<p>“Baa-baa!” he exclaimed suddenly, very clearly and
rather dramatically and stretched out his little hand
towards the picture.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Langley being summoned, had also to pause
on the threshold. He was almost overwhelmed by
the transformation, for which he was wholly unprepared.
For Big Bell had helped her mistress carry
through everything without his knowledge. He
hadn’t so much as had inkling of the fact that the
blinds had been raised every day a bit higher and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
progressively longer intervals leading up to this
handsome crisis. He felt absolutely dazed as he
looked at his wife, as if he, too, had been dwelling in
semi-darkness the while. He hadn’t seen her clearly
for years upon years and one might have expected the
strong light now to be disillusioning rather than flattering.
But not so. Russell Langley could scarcely
believe that the comely looking woman in the gay,
flowered chair with the child cherished in her arms
was his wife,—nor, indeed, that he was himself.</p>

<p>But somehow when his eyes wandered and fell upon
the other Miller girl, the sight of her steadied him.
Anna was as real as she was true blue. Wherefore
everything was real, even that splotch of sunshine on
the purple and crimson carpet which had so enchanted
his youthful masculine fancy.</p>

<p>“What are you standing there for, Russell?” asked
his wife in a voice and with a manner that were singularly
what they would have been had husband and
wife come through the twenty years hand-in-hand instead
of separately. “Come here and listen to this
wonderful baby.”</p>

<p>He obeyed as one in a dream. But when he stood
over her, as he bent and kissed her, it cost him an
effort not to try to take the child from her into his
own arms. Mrs. Langley pointed her lean finger
towards the lamb in the picture.</p>

<p>“What’s that, baby? What’s that, darling child?”
she begged his royal highness to declare.</p>

<p>“Baa-baa,” returned the child, and looking up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Anna almost smiled. The girl dropped at his feet
enraptured. Then she caught sight of the giantess as
she had endeavoured to peep in unseen and called her
in. Bell joined the group in an instant.</p>

<p>“O an’ the little angel he is, ma’am!” she exclaimed.
“O to have him in me arrums but the oncet. Would
he come to the likes of me, Miss Anna?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Bell,” said Anna, though Mrs. Langley
frowned upon the bold request. But Big Bell held out
her great strong arms, and, the baby responding with
unusual readiness, gathered him tenderly into them.
Mrs. Langley, who yielded him ungraciously, watched
Bell suspiciously as she marched about the room with
him, showing him the colleen on the parlour clock and
the wee people on the silver water-pitcher. But when
Bell put a bright blue worsted mat with a fringe of
tassels on top of her head and cocked it at the baby,
winking one eye, and the baby actually and unmistakably
smiled, Mrs. Langley smiled, too. Nevertheless,
she couldn’t endure it another second and demanded
that Joe, Junior, be returned to her at once.</p>

<p>Bell was bold enough to ask her if she felt she was
strong enough, and then gave him up reluctantly. “I’ve
a way with ’em same’s ever,” she declared defiantly.
“I brought up my sister’s babies till her man married
again, and when I first went into service it was as a
nurse.” She would have gone on, but suddenly her
feelings overcame her and she turned and fled.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On her way home, Anna prudently decided to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
nothing of the marvel of the baby’s talking until after
he should have gone to sleep. After that had happened
she related the story dramatically to the assembled
family.</p>

<p>They were all greatly excited, but the boys were
wild with anticipation and could scarcely wait until
morning. Though it was Sunday and dark, they were
up and dressed at six o’clock and had a long, weary
wait before the hero made his appearance. But the
instant Joe, Junior, finished his porridge, they fetched
his picture book. It was already open at L and Anna
was as much delighted as they when he promptly said
Baa! to the lamb.</p>

<p>“Ask him something else, quick!” cried Freddy, as
if there were not a moment to lose.</p>

<p>“O Freddy, that’s no fair. He’s only a baby. You
mustn’t expect too much of him,” cautioned Anna.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Fred Miller, don’t you dare turn that
page,” added the elder brother sternly. “You’ll get
him mixed up and scared and then he’ll never say baa
again. Don’t you dare. We’ll practise him a while
on this now.”</p>

<p>Freddy snatched the book, opened it at random in
his haste, and before Frank could interfere demanded
of the baby what <i>that</i> might be. The choice was unfortunate,
<i>that</i> being an hippopotamus with a gaping
red mouth.</p>

<p>“Moo moo!” cried the baby almost dramatically,
and the boys shouted for joy. Then alike unmindful
of threats and warnings, they went through the book,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
and the astonishing baby had an answer for every
question. He wasn’t always right, but he only appeared
the more clever. He said <i>bow-wow</i> for the
camel but he gave a really creditable roar for the cinnamon
bear.</p>

<p>In truth, Joe, Junior, seemed to have come into his
own. Not only did Anna and the boys hang over him
spell-bound and Seth Miller seem glued to the spot,
but Mrs. Miller left her work not only patiently but
eagerly whenever the boys summoned her, and once
she bent over the baby and kissed him.</p>

<p>Not long after the others had gone to service, Mrs.
Lorraine came in. She made Anna lie down on the
sofa and sat beside her.</p>

<p>“I understand the baby has begun to talk,” she
observed.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Lorraine! Already? Who told you?”
asked the girl eagerly.</p>

<p>“Your father and mother and Frank each told me
separately, and Frank and Freddy together. And Miss
Penny told me last evening. Mr. Langley told someone
and Mr. Phelps heard it at the post office.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad ma told you,” Anna remarked. “She’s
beginning to take to him. She kissed him this morning.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine sighed. Anna had been pale when
she came in. Now her cheeks were crimson and her
eyes too bright. She was always thin, but to-day her
face looked pinched. Anna was second only to Alice
herself in Mrs. Lorraine’s heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Anna, I wish you would find a home for that baby
or let some of us,” she said anxiously. “The responsibility
is too much for you. Many people would be
glad to take him, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Glad! my goodness, they’d jump at the chance!”
rejoined Anna. “And well they might. I did think
that I would give him away, but I don’t believe now
that I could part with him. And it’s different now.
The boys are crazy over him and so is pa. And now
that ma——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine perceived that she had taken the
wrong tack. She must try again.</p>

<p>“But Anna, having him keeps you from so many
things. They really need you in the choir, you know.”</p>

<p>“Alice might sing in the choir. Her voice is better
than mine and she knows heaps more about music.”</p>

<p>“Alice wouldn’t go in without you, and her voice
really isn’t so sweet. And your mother needs you,
Anna. Like most mothers, she has been tied at home
for years, and it seems a pity that just as she begins
to go about she should lose your companionship. And
your school-mates——”</p>

<p>As Anna sat up, suddenly she looked so distressed
that Mrs. Lorraine’s heart failed her. She had never
been a very considerate woman—hadn’t taken any
thought to avoid hurting the feelings of others. But
she must have become more sensitive of late. Certainly
it hurt her to hurt the girl before her.</p>

<p>“You see, dear child, you are just the sort of person
everyone wants a share of, but little Joe quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
monopolises you,” she went on more gently. “You
and Alice were reading <i>Retaliation</i> the other day, you
know. Well, you’re like the line on Burke. You give
up to Joe, Junior, what was meant for mankind.”</p>

<p>Anna laughed, though ruefully. She rose and made
a movement to smooth her hair, then remembered
that her braid was gone and shook her short locks.
Seating herself in a straight chair, she folded her
hands over her knee.</p>

<p>“One reason why I hate to give him up, Mrs. Lorraine,
is because he’s Bessy’s baby and Joe’s,” she
began wistfully. “He’s the only part of them and of
that life that I’ve got left, you see. Not that I want
ever to go back to it. I love the Hollow and Farleigh
and all the people, and yet there’s something that
makes me feel I don’t want to forget the other altogether.
Bessy wore a pompadour that made even me
shiver and she chewed gum, and Joe would have looked
like a jumping-jack beside Reuben, and yet Bessy and
Joe were both true blue. Bessy got all run down
while Joe was sick going without things so that he
could have milk and eggs, and when he got back to
work he went without lunches so that she would
think his pay was the same as it had been. And if
Hazel or I or any of their friends had had hard luck,
they would have taken them in and done everything
for them the same as Hazel did for Bessy when the
time came.”</p>

<p>She looked entreatingly into Mrs. Lorraine’s dark
eyes, which were sympathetic but perplexed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“You can’t understand how it is, unless you live
right among them, but if you once have, there’s something
mighty precious in the memory of that life that
you wouldn’t lose hold of. If I didn’t want Joe,
Junior, myself, I should want him because he’s Bessy’s
and Joe’s,” she said earnestly.</p>

<p>The girl was very quiet all the rest of the day. She
pondered sadly over what Mrs. Lorraine had said
and over what her words had further implied. She
had not realised that they had missed her, her mother
and the boys and Miss Penny and Alice—Alice most
of all, perhaps, though her mother didn’t dream that.
Perhaps she could do things for them that others
couldn’t, while the baby would really be better off
with the Langleys. Mr. Langley and Bell Adams
would be wonderful with him and it began to look as
if Mrs. Langley would make a creditable mother. And
Alice needed her; and Alice’s mother needed something
in Alice which perhaps only Anna could watch out
for. And Alice had never been really happy until she
was twenty and Mrs. Lorraine not until she was forty-five.
And both had been so frightfully unhappy. And
there was that terrible black shadow of the prison
hanging over them for ten years to come.</p>

<p>Giving up Joe, Junior, was of course only what she
had planned to do in the first place. It was only what
she had worked and struggled for ever since she had
returned with the baby. And even before that, she
had been longing to discover some means of repaying
Mr. Langley for all he had done for Rusty and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
family in general and to comfort him for losing his
little Ella May after all the years. Yet now that she
had it within her power to give him something that
would be like his heart’s desire, she was grudging it.
But O—that darling baby! And he loved her as he
cared for no one else.</p>

<p>On a sudden, Anna decided to go to evening service.
She had kissed the baby in his sleep and almost
thought he smiled, and as she flew over the frozen
ground, her heart grew light again. Her own words
came back to her. “The baby loves me best.” They
echoed in her heart and she almost danced along to
their melody. He loved her best and therefore he
belonged to her as he could belong to no other. For,
after all, there was nothing like love. Advantages
and all sorts of material goods couldn’t compete with
it. She was going to keep Joe, Junior, always.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANNA MILLER went forth exultantly, hugging
the certainty to her heart that Joe, Junior, loved
her best and that she had, therefore, a right to keep
him to grow up in an household wherein everyone
loved and wanted him. But all her elation died out at
the sight of Mr. Langley’s face as it looked down from
the pulpit. He looked as he had never looked before,
and the girl knew only too well that it was all because
of the baby’s visit to the parsonage yesterday. He
looked weary—at once wistfully and radiantly weary.
He looked as if he had been through floods and stood
on mountain summits. He looked, poor dear, as if he
ought to have a darling, cuddling, prattling baby at
the parsonage all the time.</p>

<p>So the question was unsettled again and settled the
other way, though Anna lay awake for hours that night
before she announced the painful decision formally to
herself. And even then she did not dare trust herself
until she had burned all her bridges behind her. She
hastened over to the parsonage late Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>At the door, Big Bell enquired eagerly though shyly
for the blessed baby. When Anna told her of his
feats with the picture book, Bell laughed and choked
and got out of the way quickly to conceal her tears.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
Anna’s eyes were moist as she entered Mrs. Langley’s
room.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Langley, what do you think now?” she
cried, and proceeded to relate the story of the pictures
at greater length. And as she told it, she and Mrs.
Langley laughed and cried together in new intimacy.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you bring him with you?” Mrs. Langley
asked wistfully. And the girl’s heart sank to feel
how fatally easy it was to be to give away the baby.
She spoke very low in order to keep her voice steady.</p>

<p>“Because—O, Mrs. Langley, I don’t think we’ll keep
little Joe. We all love him—even ma, but we don’t
really need him and—don’t you know someone who
would like a baby boy that talks?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley stared at the girl. The blinds were
raised to-day, though not so high, and she wore the
pretty gown and becoming arrangement of her hair.
She looked even more attractive than she had on Saturday,
for she seemed used to the change. It was
almost as if she had always let in the sunshine and
the rich rosy afterglow which prevailed now and had
never resembled Red-Riding-Hood’s wolf in her
grandmother’s cap and gown. And Anna jumped
at the conclusion any young or immature person might
have made that the transformation within must be as
complete and thorough.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like him yourself—you and Mr.
Langley?” she asked gently. “If so, I’ll give him to
you as a Christmas present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Mrs. Langley only stared the more blankly. The
idea was absolutely new and strange to her mind and
therefore startling. Never in all her life before had
she been so surprised, so astounded.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a sharp twinge of neuralgia, zigzagging
up her face into her head converted her confusion
into a sort of blind rage. As it died away, it left her
with a sensation of faintness and sickness.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are thinking of, Anna
Miller, to—to—upset me so!” she cried querelously.
“Of course we couldn’t have him here and I an invalid!
It would kill me—break my heart.”</p>

<p>As for Anna, she was quite confounded. Absolutely
unprepared for the refusal of the precious gift
it had cost her so much to proffer, the repetition of that
hateful, meaningless phrase irritated her keenly. But
for Mr. Langley’s sake, she spoke with measure.</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Langley, I thought you were better—a
heap better,” she protested. “Tell me, does your head
ache at this very minute?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley considered, or tried to do so. “I
can’t tell,” she snapped. “I think it must, but I am
so wrought up I’m sure I can’t tell. But I know this.
As soon as you go, I shall find myself suffering torture,
and it’s likely to keep up all night.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to excite you,” murmured
Anna meekly. “But Joe, Junior, wouldn’t
excite you, not a bit. And he wouldn’t be any trouble
even to a worse invalid than you were when you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
at your very sickest. He isn’t at all like other babies.
Big Bell would take all the care of him—she knows
how to handle ’em and she’s crazy about him already.
And Mr. Langley would play with him—he’d love to,
too—and then whenever you wanted to see him and
hear the little love talk, why all you’d have to do would
be to have him brought in—ask Bell for him.”</p>

<p>“And like as not Bell would have an excuse all ready.
I know Bell Adams better than you do, Anna Miller!
She’d keep him to herself all the time and when I
wanted him, she’d say he was having a nap. And he’d
like Mr. Langley better than he would me and he
wouldn’t come to me from him. And—O dear, O
dear, why did you come here with your wild notions
stirring me up so that I sha’n’t get a wink of sleep all
night!”</p>

<p>Anna looked desperately and forlornly at the big
purple roses. A long pause ensued which Mrs. Langley
finally broke.</p>

<p>“Anna, I would like to have you bring the baby
over here just as often as you can,” she said in a conciliatory
way. “Of course it wouldn’t be wise for me
to have him in the house all the time in my delicate
state of health, as you would know if you were older
or had had experience with illness. But I would dearly
love to have you bring him over every day besides all
Saturday afternoons.”</p>

<p>Slow to anger as the girl was, she wasn’t proof
against this. She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Not on your tintype!” she cried hotly. “That baby
shall never come to this house again unless he comes
to stay—never! never! I’ve got something else to do
than tote him way over here every day, and if you
want to see him days you’ve got to shelter him nights.
Not that the darling has to go a begging for shelter,
for I’m sure I don’t want to give him away. But I’ll
give you one more chance. Do you want him to keep,
or will you never look on his face again?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley began to remonstrate peevishly. Anna
repeated her demand fiercely.</p>

<p>“O Anna, I couldn’t think of doing that. It would
break my heart,” Mrs. Langley almost wailed. Anna
turned at the door.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. It’s settled,” she cried, “and you
shall never have him, never! I wanted to keep him
myself and now I will and there’ll be no more fussing
about it. I shall give up my life to him and never
marry. And, believe me, I shall never come near this
house again!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, I’m glad to hear that!” retorted Mrs.
Langley. “Don’t flatter yourself that it’s any favour
to me your coming here and ordering me round and
stirring me all up in this fashion. I’ll thank you to
pull that curtain down and leave me alone.”</p>

<p>Anna yanked at the blind viciously and down it
came, fixture and all, with a sad crash. Startled out
of her wrath, the girl was ashamed and confused. She
was sick at heart, too, with the significance of it, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
drawing down of the blind that had let in light for
only a fortnight out of twenty-odd years. But she
fled precipitately, pausing only to send Bell in to her
mistress. And she believed herself to be leaving the
house forever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the day following her second meeting with the
stranger who called himself John Converse,
Alice Lorraine was in a sad state of mind when she
reached the lane. She <i>had</i> to see the man again. She
told herself that ordinary civility as well as her own
desire demanded that. Chance had brought them together
and put upon her the duty of aiding him so far
as possible in looking up old associations without
making himself known in the village of his birth and
boyhood. She had somehow lost her head and become
involved in a warm dispute. That made it hard for
her to act to-day. But she told herself that she was
not going back as the girl who had been vehement
over—nothing! She was simply going to meet John
Converse (for the last time, probably) in the odd
little shop, give him such information as she was
able, and if he should wish, help him plan his course
of action. Then they would part in the polite way of
people who have become acquainted in the course of a
long railway journey and offered one another kindly
civilities.</p>

<p>It would be simple enough, she told herself, if she
could only remember that he belonged to an older generation.
He didn’t look young and he couldn’t be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
with a memory reaching back as far as his did. It was
only his sad eyes which could become so merry and
the whimsical smile that transformed his gaunt face
that had made her feel as if he were a companion of
her own years.</p>

<p>As the girl stole around the cottage towards the
path leading to the shop, John Converse rose quickly
from the step of the back porch and joined her. He
held out his hand eagerly and she put hers shyly into
it, her face expressing the relief she felt to find that
he was not resentful. She realised now that she had
feared that if he were about at all he would be stiff
and cold.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you wouldn’t come,” he said with a
frank smile. “I have had a nasty night, I can tell
you. And now I want to explain to you right away
what must have seemed to you inexcusable behaviour.
Shall we sit down here?”</p>

<p>Alice thought of his safety. And she suggested that
they might as well go into the shop. As they entered,
she noted that there was a fire and the same preparations
for tea he had made the day before.</p>

<p>He took her jacket, made her comfortable, prepared
the tea and served her. Alice, with a sense of relief
that was like happiness, leaned back in her chair and
watched him admiringly. She had never known a
man to be so deft, and gazing at his hands she noticed
that, though the skin was hard and rough and
they must have done the work of a labourer, they
were the long, sensitive, slender hands of the sculptor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
or musician—probably the latter. And suddenly her
lips puckered in an involuntary smile.</p>

<p>“What pleases you, if I may ask?” he said wonderingly.
He himself was very serious,—sad, almost.
There was no hint now of the whimsicality that made
him so young—nor of the youthful impulsiveness with
which he had met her to-day.</p>

<p>Alice looked into his eyes ingenuously. “I wouldn’t
dare tell anyone else of the thought that came to me
and made me smile,” she declared. “They would mob
me, I am quite sure. You see everyone in this village—or
everyone I happen to know—is simply mad about
Reuben Cartwright. Honestly, I believe they consider
him perfect—incapable of doing anything that’s not
exactly the right thing. And I have heard so much
raving about him that I believe I am catching the
madness, or whatever you call it. Just now as you
were handling the cups so skilfully it came suddenly
to me that your hands were like Reuben’s—and mind
you, I never saw the boy!”</p>

<p>He did not smile. He only looked at her curiously.
Then he sat down opposite her.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be strange if they were alike,” he said
quietly. “It’s odd, but you have led up to the explanation
I was about to make. I feel, Miss Lorraine,
that I owe it to you to tell you who I really am. You
trusted me without a shred of evidence of my integrity,
and you granted my wish for secrecy. I ought
to have told you, anyhow. But having lost my temper
and made shockingly uncivil remarks to you, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
cannot do otherwise. The reason I fired up when you
were ready to believe ill—the worst—of Dick Cartwright
is the same reason that Reuben Cartwright’s
hands and mine may look alike, though I trust his
aren’t so calloused and generally bunged up. I am
Reuben Cartwright’s father.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t, of course, the same shock to Alice Lorraine
the announcement would have been to one who
had known Richard Cartwright or his son Reuben.
But the girl paled.</p>

<p>“But I thought he was dead—<i>you</i>, I mean,” she
said so naively that he smiled.</p>

<p>“I may be lean and lank, but I am a right husky
ghost for all that,” he said. Then he grew serious.
“You were right in thinking so. I wanted everyone to
believe me dead, and now I feel the same, except for
you. It wasn’t only because I wouldn’t seem so rude if
you understood that I wanted you to know, Miss Lorraine;
but you seemed to think I was such a bad lot
that I wanted you to know the truth. Not that I
wasn’t a bad lot, you know, only I wasn’t quite such a
scoundrel as you apparently think. Do you mind telling
me just what impression Mr. Langley gave you of
me? I believe under the circumstances you have the
right to speak freely.”</p>

<p>Alice complied briefly. Cartwright wiped his brow
more than once.</p>

<p>“I went through a lot for nothing, then,” he said
almost bitterly. “If I had given my real name, I could
have gotten off; but I feared the notoriety for Reuben<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
and took the name of a man that was killed, for the
sake of giving him mine and having Reuben’s father
die a comparatively decent death instead of being a
convict. I was on that train but the only thing wrong
about my being there was that I didn’t pay my fare.
I was a tramp at that time and another tramp and I
were riding the bumpers—he initiated me into the
mysteries of the practise. He was killed and in the
confusion of the wreck I was arrested as one of the
gang that was responsible for it and for the deaths of
the mail clerk and engineer. They couldn’t prove anything,
but circumstantial evidence implicated me as an
accessory. My one hope of clearing myself would
have been to establish my identity as Richard Cartwright,
which, as I said, I did not choose to do.
Wherefore I landed in the penitentiary.”</p>

<p>The girl gave a little involuntary, startled, deprecating
cry. Richard Cartwright faced her almost
sternly with folded arms.</p>

<p>“You have been there—not ever since?” she protested.
He told her that he had served two years of a
sentence of five when the confession of a member of
the gang who died of consumption had freed him.</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you come back here then?” she
cried.</p>

<p>“If you could have seen me the day after I left the
prison, you wouldn’t ask,” he said bitterly. “I became
a bum on the spot. I deliberately took up the drink
habit again and became a drunkard and a tramp. I
kept at it for three years—years that are almost a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
blank to me now. Then something happened—I don’t
know what it was—that set me thinking of Reuben
and Farleigh and Russell Langley and I decided to
stop long enough to put myself into shape to come
East and see if they were alive and how things were
going on and all that. That was nearly a year ago. I
stopped drinking, went to work, earned and saved
money enough to clothe myself decently and to take
this sight-seeing trip, and—here I am.”</p>

<p>Again he wiped his damp brow with his pocket
handkerchief and looked at the girl—defiantly, bitterly,
yet deprecatingly and wistfully.</p>

<p>“But why don’t you stay, now?” she cried. “And
why don’t you see Mr. Langley and Reuben? Though
I know Reuben only by hearsay, I know enough of him
to know that he would be—<i>crazy</i> to see you.”</p>

<p>She smiled tremulously. “He’s the faithful sort, if
I’m not,” she said.</p>

<p>“O Miss Lorraine, don’t hit a fellow who’s down,”
he begged.</p>

<p>“But you will—you will stay and—you will see
them, Reuben and Mr. Langley?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Lorraine, I cannot stay. And I’ll see
them, but I won’t let them see me and I will remain
dead to everyone but you just the same. I will roam
about dear old Farleigh and see the changes, and I
won’t hurry, but—I’ll go back presently. This is only
a vacation,—a sight-seeing trip on the part of John
Converse.”</p>

<p>“Back to what?” asked the girl imperiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“Back to being a good, honest day-labourer, if you
say so, Miss Lorraine,” he assured her.</p>

<p>“Well, but I don’t say so,” she retorted. “I want
you to be a musician. I want you to have your old
house back and to build——”</p>

<p>Her voice broke. He was silent a little. Then he
reached forth his hard, beautifully shaped hands.</p>

<p>“Look at those—<i>hoofs!</i> On nearer view do they
look like a musician’s?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The hands do and you could easily soften the skin,”
she declared.</p>

<p>“I learned cobbling in prison and did it for two
years,” he remarked, and the girl paled sensitively, and
her eyes fell.</p>

<p>“And my job now is work in a shoe factory, and so
it must be for——”</p>

<p>“So it must not! No such thing!” she interrupted.</p>

<p>He smiled at her fire, and she thought he was ready
to be persuaded. And for some little time, Alice Lorraine
urged him to alter what she found to be a bitterly
fixed determination. But she was still shaken and confused
by the excitement and emotion she had undergone,
and presently she gave over for the moment,
feeling that she could do better by waiting until she
should have pondered over the matter alone. However,
she secured his promise not to return to the West
without letting her know nor without seeing her. By
that time it was late and agreeing to meet him the next
day, she took leave.</p>

<p>The next day Dick Cartwright told her that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
decided to remain hereabouts for a fortnight if he was
lucky enough to escape detection, after which he would
go to the town where Reuben was attending college,
preferring to see him there rather than in Farleigh at
the Christmas holidays. Then he would stop here and
tell her about it on his way West. He begged her
earnestly not to try to dissuade him. His purpose was
fixed, and it only caused him intense pain to have her
attempt to alter it.</p>

<p>Warm-hearted Alice agreed to desist temporarily at
least and to help make his days in Farleigh successful
whether they were only holidays or, as she continued
secretly to hope, the beginning of a second residence.
She learned all she could about Reuben to relate to his
father when she met him, which was daily except when
Alice was prevented from getting away, which happened
only twice. She told him something more of
Mr. Langley almost every time she saw him and
learned the history of every person he mentioned any
desire to know about. She helped him plan his nightly
wanderings about the place, shared one of them and
listened eagerly to what he told her of his experiences.
She even managed to get him into the church one
Sunday afternoon and to coax him to play a few bars
on the familiar organ, the sight of which brought tears
to his eyes. At moments when they were in good
spirits they called themselves a pair of conspirators and
wondered at the success which attended Dick Cartwright.
For Alice assured him again and again that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
no one dreamed of there being any stranger in the
place.</p>

<p>The days flew over Alice Lorraine’s head, her only
regret being that she had no opportunity to plead with
Dick Cartwright to reconsider his resolve. At home,
as was perhaps not unnatural, she appeared nervous
and was ready to be irritable as she had never been
before. She was careless of others and remiss in her
duties. And yet she was not utterly so. For a new
feeling for her father had been aroused in her, a pity
and sympathy the girl could never have experienced
otherwise. She thought much of him and wrote him
two long letters in the fortnight that elapsed before
Dick Cartwright left Farleigh to go in search of
Reuben.</p>

<p>On the night he was to leave, Alice, who was supposed
to be in her room whither she had withdrawn
early, met him at a point in the South Hollow which
they had agreed upon. She entreated him to make
himself known to his son and let him help make the
final decision, but Cartwright was adamant.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t explain to Reuben without letting him
know that I have been in prison,” he finally explained
reluctantly and quite as if that ended the argument.</p>

<p>“Yes, but <i>innocently</i>!” she cried.</p>

<p>“That makes little difference. I would rather die
than have Reuben know he is the son of one who has
been a prisoner,” he declared proudly.</p>

<p>Alice withdrew her arm from his. “You think it so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
terrible a stigma as all that, Mr. Cartwright?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“I would rather die than have Reuben know it,” he
repeated warmly.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> father is in prison now!” she cried. “And
he—he is—he isn’t innocent!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WE’RE goin’ to have a green Christmas, sure’s
you’re born,” remarked the usually stolid and
reticent Bell Adams. “I only hope the rest of it don’t
follow. Dear me, if that delicate motherless baby
should be took!”</p>

<p>“Bell Adams, I don’t know what you mean, talking
like that to me,” cried her mistress. “Just because I’ve
forced myself to endure the strong light and have
changed a little outwardly, you treat me as if I were
as well and strong as anyone. You used to be so careful,
Bell.”</p>

<p>That was quite true,—also that Bell had borne herself
differently of late. She had not, as a matter of
fact, been the same woman since the visit of Anna
Miller and Joe, Junior, when she had held the baby in
her arms. And since she had in some manner come
to understand that the child had been offered to the
household and refused by Mrs. Langley, she had been
so thoroughly indignant that she could scarcely speak
to her mistress. But silence being her usual role, it
was only when her anger had cooled into sulkiness that
Mrs. Langley felt and resented the strangeness of her
demeanour.</p>

<p>“And why you should pick out that little innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
baby—” Mrs. Langley went on in an aggrieved voice.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a-pickin’ of him out,” retorted Bell. “If
anybody’s doin’ that it’s the Lord, and if He’s marked
him out for early death, why, there you are. And
anyways, the little mite hasn’t no real home, so to
speak. And he’s too bright to grow up. He ought to
be tenderly cherished with that bulgin’ forehead, and
his speakin’ out so sudden and complete wasn’t
natural.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley was too affected to reply. Bell hastened
back to the kitchen, for it was the day before
Christmas and she was deep in preparation.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed and a shadow fell across her
table. Bell looked up in amazement to see her mistress
before her. Mrs. Langley had not left her room for
years, and Bell was really frightened.</p>

<p>“For the dear sake, Mis’ Langley, you out of your
head?” she cried.</p>

<p>“No, Bell, but I felt upset. I wish you would come
in and sit with me for a little, but you must be quiet.
I don’t want you to say a word. You stirred me all
up with your chatter about green Christmases.”</p>

<p>“But ma’am, I’m makin’ cranberry jell, and I must
get this mince pie into the oven for Mr. Langley’s
Christmas dinner,” returned Bell.</p>

<p>She glanced at her mistress out of the tail of her
eye, and, apparently deciding that she could go further
with impunity, added:</p>

<p>“It’s bad enough as it is, him a-eatin’ of it all alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>Mrs. Langley flushed. That woman was getting
unbearable.</p>

<p>“If you pity Mr. Langley, I should like to know
what you think of me, Bell Adams?” she cried. “I
must not only eat alone but I am forced to remain
alone all the time and to suffer constant pain.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I know,” Bell relented. “’Tis hard, dear
knows. And yet, men are different from we women,
and sometimes I mistrust they suffer as much from
bein’ lonesome as we do from real pain. And then
of course he’s been as good as a widower all these
years and——”</p>

<p>“Bell Adams——”</p>

<p>“O, ma’am, you ought not to be standin’ and in
this hot kitchin and like a summer day outside and the
twenty-fourth day of December. Now why don’t you
go into the front room and set a spell and watch the
folks go by? They’s a lot of passin’ the day before
Christmas, and you can see way to the post office now
that the leaves is off. Rusty Miller’s home, they say,
and you may see her. You’ll know her by her red hair.
Everybody mistrusted she’d come home from college
with it done up in a p’siky but it seems she ain’t.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langley was tempted by her suggestion. It
didn’t seem as if she could go back to her room and
think about green Christmases and that over-bright
baby and Mr. Langley’s having been like a widower all
these years. Wherefore, when Bell went before and
led her to the at once familiar and strange room, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
followed and allowed herself to be established comfortably
in a big chair before the low window.</p>

<p>She had not been there ten minutes when she
was secretly blaming Bell for not having thought of
this before. Indeed, if it had not been for haunting
thoughts of Anna and the baby, she would have been
quite comfortable. It occurred to her that Joe, Junior,
would like to be sitting on her lap looking out the
window with her. There was a Newfoundland dog—she
wondered if he would know what it was and say
<i>bow-wow</i>?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Joe, Junior, was saying <i>bow-wow</i>
to every dog he saw that afternoon, thereby nearly
convulsing Freddy Miller who walked at his side. The
boys wheeled him all the way from the Hollow to the
post office in his new perambulator.</p>

<p>Rusty had brought it home with her as a Christmas
present for her sister. After she had gone away in the
early autumn, Rusty had begun to feel as if she had
been less than fair to Anna. She had been deeply impressed
by her sister’s devotion to the baby and by the
sacrifice of her beautiful hair. It was like Rusty to
desire to make her atonement concrete, and she had
saved all her pocket money towards a Christmas present
for Anna, expecting to get something handsome in
the way of jewelry or other personal adornment. But
when she had made secret enquiries of the family, no
one knew of anything that Anna really wanted, except
that Frank suspected she was saving her money for a
perambulator for Joe, Junior. Whereupon Rusty purchased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
an handsome carriage that was convertible into
a sleigh.</p>

<p>Anna had been overwhelmed with delight. The
perambulator had been placed in the parlour and
covered by a sheet, that the baby should not see it
before Christmas day.</p>

<p>Against this, however, the boys had protested
loudly. They declared they wanted to be sure to use
it before the runners should be put on, and everyone
said there was a storm due, and it would be too mean
for anything if they couldn’t try the wheels before
April. The baby was so little he wouldn’t know the
difference, anyhow. But Anna would not yield.</p>

<p>Reuben was to arrive at Wenham the day before
Christmas, and Rusty was to drive over to meet him
with Miss Penny’s pony. It occurred to her that
morning to ask Anna to go with her.</p>

<p>Anna flushed to the roots of her dandelion hair, as
Frank called it. Then she remembered the baby and
told Rusty she couldn’t leave him.</p>

<p>“Ma’s got baking to do, and I couldn’t have her
bothered, Rusty.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll sit on the floor and not be the least
trouble,” urged her sister.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to risk anything now, Rusty,” Anna
confessed. “Ma didn’t take to him at first, and now
she’s begun to, I don’t want any setback. I want him
to live with us always, you see.”</p>

<p>“O, Anna, you’ll never have any more fun then,”
protested Rusty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Junior’s all the fun I want,” returned Anna rather
shyly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, the boys can mind him this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“They could, but I don’t believe they will. Frank’s
mad with me because I won’t let him use the perambulator.”</p>

<p>Rusty appealed to her mother.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s no use, Rusty,” returned Mrs.
Miller. “Frank’s a good boy, but when he gets a
contrary streak, he isn’t to be coaxed. And I shouldn’t
like to <i>make</i> him mind the baby, for fear he might
turn against him, and it’s good for the boys to love
him as they do now. But I’ll look after him myself.
He’s no trouble at all; he’s just company for me.”</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t make more of him when he first
came,” she owned. “Anna won’t let me do anything
for him except in school hours, and I want her to get
into the notion of leaving him to me and getting out
more herself. It was really for her sake that I sort
of hardened my heart against the baby in the first
place,—I felt it was too much for her.”</p>

<p>Rusty kissed her mother and said she would try to
see what she could do with Frank. She sought out
her brother.</p>

<p>“Frank, you and Freddy’ll mind the baby while
Anna goes to Wenham with me to meet Reuben, won’t
you?” she begged. “You know I’ve been away so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
long you haven’t had a chance to do anything for me
for weeks and weeks.”</p>

<p>“Why Rusty Miller,” the boy exclaimed, “ain’t
writing letters anything,—with ink, too! It takes the
whole evening, even if you begin the minute the table
cloth’s off.”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed, Frank, it’s a lot, and it’s a great comfort
to get them,” Rusty owned, “but answer me quick
so that Anna can change her dress before dinner. And
I’ll tell Reuben how good you are.”</p>

<p>“Fred and me was going to the post office to see the
Christmas mail come in,” objected Frank. “Anna
won’t let us haul Joe in our cart so far as that on
account of the bumps, but if you’ll let us take the
perambulator we’ll mind him dandy.”</p>

<p>Rusty argued with him but found that her mother
was right, and presently yielded.</p>

<p>“Well, do take it,” she said, “only wait until we’re
out of the way. I’ll tell Anna, but be sure she doesn’t
know it to-morrow. Wipe the wheels all off as soon
as you get back.”</p>

<p>She and Anna went away directly after dinner in
order to wander about Wenham and see the Christmas
decorations before time for Reuben’s train. Shortly
afterwards, Mrs. Miller got the baby into his wraps
and put him into the perambulator. The child looked
at the new equipage with interest and approval and
settled himself comfortably among the cushions with
an expression that was almost eager. Mrs. Miller
kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“Frank, don’t you feel a little ashamed when Anna’s
so good to you to be doing just what she doesn’t want
you to?” she asked.</p>

<p>Frank looked rather sheepish.</p>

<p>But Joe, Junior, was almost smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps one day won’t make any great difference,”
Mrs. Miller admitted indulgently.</p>

<p>“Say <i>Go</i>, baby,” urged Frank, and the child complied
instantly.</p>

<p>“Now don’t hurry,” cautioned their mother. “And
Freddy, don’t dance up and down that way. It’s long
enough there and back if you just walk without any
capers. And besides, if you jump about too much
that safety pin will give and your stocking will be
all down around your foot.”</p>

<p>Of course Freddy forgot the warning. Joe, Junior,
repeating <i>Go, go</i>, Freddy was in an ecstasy, and was
hardly out of sight before his stocking was trailing in
the dust. The day being unseasonably warm he rather
liked it so, and didn’t mind the halting gait it induced.
But Frank objected to the latter, and drawing the
stocking up over the little boy’s trousers, fastened it
securely if not elegantly with the safety pin. Whereupon
they rushed on and reached the post office an
hour before the mail was due.</p>

<p>After a little the elder brother went inside, cautioning
the younger not to wheel the carriage while he
was gone. When Freddy grew tired of waiting, he
moved it, pushing it sidewise, and went in to tell Frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
that the sun was shining right into the baby’s eyes,
and couldn’t he just wheel him into the shade?</p>

<p>But when he entered, the post master was telling his
brother how many parcels had come on the stage a
year ago on the twenty-fourth of December, and what
he calculated would have been their combined weight
in pounds. He put it to Frank how many ounces that
would be, and Freddy stood spell-bound while his
brother computed it ‘in his head.’ Further delay was
occasioned by the fact that Frank got his answer according
to the avoirdupois scale and had to be reminded
that he should have used the Troy, and to
multiply all over by sixteen, which was more difficult
than reckoning by the dozen.</p>

<p>When finally the matter was settled, the little boy
put his request.</p>

<p>“Of course, silly,” returned Frank, and went on
talking with the post master. Presently Freddy returned.</p>

<p>“He ain’t there,” he said in a dazed way.</p>

<p>“What you givin’ us?” demanded his brother.</p>

<p>Freddy burst into tears. “He ain’t there, cross my
neck, Frank. Nothin’ but a pillow,” he declared, “O,
O, the bears must ’a eat him up!”</p>

<p>Frank rushed out. The perambulator was indeed
empty. For an instant he stared at it in amazement.
Then he decided it was a trick of some of the boys in
Farleigh and tiptoed about peering into all possible
and impossible corners and hiding-places. But there
was no one in sight.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SETH MILLER returned home shortly after the
boys. Greatly alarmed, he rushed over to Miss
Penny’s and frightened her still more. But Mrs. Lorraine
spoke calmly and suggested that he get Walter
Phelps to drive him over to the post office, enquiring
all the way, and if he did not find the baby meantime,
someone in the crowd collected for the mail would be
sure to have tidings of him.</p>

<p>The stage was late and they reached the post office
just as it drove up. Anna stepped out, white and
anxious. She had learned the news at Wenham just
in time to catch the coach.</p>

<p>The girl did not lose an instant. She consulted the
post master who had enquired of everyone who had
come in. He had no information to offer. Her father
had stopped at every house except the parsonage, Miss
Penny having cautioned him not to go there because of
the invalid. Wherefore Seth Miller supposed that they
had better be working over Wenham way.</p>

<p>But Anna decided otherwise. Asking Walter to
remain at the post office for possible tidings, she had
her father drive her to the parsonage. Three minutes
after she had let herself quietly in, she came running
out to the buggy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Mrs. Langley’s gone, too,” she said. “Dear me,
isn’t it great luck that Mr. Langley’s way at the further
end of the Hollow? We met him, and I suppose he’s
talking school business with Mr. Phillips. He’d be
perfectly crazy, you know.”</p>

<p>She climbed into the buggy.</p>

<p>“Did you look in the garret?” her father enquired.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, but Bell went everywhere
else,” Anna returned. Her father stared at her for
she seemed less anxious.</p>

<p>“Anna, someone may have kidnapped the two of
’em,” he said hoarsely. “I don’t know as you have
heard, but they do say there’s a strange man around
the village peering in windows at night and the like.”</p>

<p>Anna almost laughed. “They’d bring Mrs. Langley
back when daylight came,” she returned flippantly.</p>

<p>She directed her father to drive down the Wenham
road, beyond the house where they had lived when the
boys were babies, to the bridge and to watch from
there, dropping her at a point she would indicate.</p>

<p>“Give me your bandana,” she ordered. “Now, Pa,
if you see me waving it, you come straight towards it
as far as you can come with a horse and wait. I’m
going cross lots but you may see me later against
the western sky line.”</p>

<p>“O Anna, I don’t dare have you go off alone away
from beaten tracks with strange men and kidnappers
about,” he protested. “Let me hitch the horse and go
with you.”</p>

<p>But Anna laughed, reassured him, and disappeared.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Making a bit of detour to avoid being seen, she headed
for the cemetery. Anxious still, she was nevertheless
relieved, and once on the direct path, ran all the way,
leaping ditches, pushing through underbrush and
taking the steepest part of the bank as if it were a
plain. When she reached the top, she was hot and
breathless. Throwing her jacket on top of the wall,
she vaulted it lightly and made for a point whence
she could see the Langley lot. Even while she caught
her breath and wondered if she should dare look, she
heard a little familiar sound.</p>

<p>The girl stopped short. For a second she could not
move. The complete relief from suspense was so great
that she had to choke back her tears. For there they
were, just where she hard hardly dared to think of
them as being, Mrs. Langley wrapped in a gay old-fashioned
paisley shawl with her head uncovered, sitting
on the ground with Joe, Junior, in her lap. The
baby was fondling the little marble image and murmuring
baa-baa, the while Mrs. Langley looked on
as if she were in Paradise.</p>

<p>As she stole towards the little group and stood before
them, Anna was unaware that tears were streaming
down her cheeks. The baby saw her first and smiled.
“Baa-baa” he cried out stretching out his hands, and
Mrs. Langley looked up quickly. Her expression
changed instantly from beatitude to deep guilt.</p>

<p>“You said you would give him to me for a Christmas
present, anyhow, Anna,” she declared, half defiantly,
half-entreatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“Yes, but you didn’t—take him,” gasped Anna
dropping down beside them. She was hugging Joe,
Junior, but she did not take him into her arms.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t. I’ve been sorry ever since. But
you took me so by surprise. Of course I really wanted
him when I could straighten out my thoughts.”</p>

<p>“We have all been frightened nearly to death thinking
the little fellow was lost,” Anna remarked reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that,” Mrs. Langley returned
meekly, stroking the baby’s little hand. “I saw him
go by and I wanted to see him so badly that I got my
shawl and followed as far as the post office. He was
all alone and so near the road that a horse might have
run over him if it shied. Really, Anna, I was just
meaning to stand by him until your brothers came out;
but he reached out his little hands and I had to take
him—he knew me, you see. For he said Baa-baa, and
it seemed as if he was asking me to bring him to see
this little lamb; and as I wanted to see it myself, I
brought him up here.”</p>

<p>“Brought him up here!” exclaimed Anna suddenly
realizing the magnitude of the action. “How in this
world did you ever do it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure, but he didn’t seem heavy.
He’s so still, I suppose. I didn’t mean to stay at all,
but it is so warm and pleasant; and baby has been so
happy that I forgot everything else.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile, Seth Miller had driven out to the bridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and waited, talking the while to the Phelps horse
which, like most of the horses in the village, was a
great pet and like one of the family. Presently he
caught a flash of red among the pines on the hill, saw
his daughter waving to him, and drove on until he
saw her waiting at the lower gate of the cemetery with
the baby and a strange, foreign-looking woman whom
he took to be a gypsy who had probably been carrying
the baby away when Anna caught her. Again and
again that night at home he exclaimed over his surprise
to think that the old and faded woman with the
piercing black eyes who might have been a gypsy crone
was none other than the handsome Mr. Langley’s wife.
And yet he granted she was pleasant-spoken and the
baby seemed to take to her amazingly and he only
hoped she wasn’t out of her head.</p>

<p>Anna got out with Mrs. Langley at the parsonage
and asked her father to bring the baby in. Seth Miller
held the baby close, whispering to him and lengthening
the inconsiderable distance by crawling along, the
while Anna explained that she would have to go in for
a little and asked him to stop at Miss Penny’s with
the news and have someone come for her with the
pony later.</p>

<p>“And pa, if you see Mr. Langley, send him home
right away,” she added eagerly. “Or—if you happen
to hear where he is, do go get him and bring him
home.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Seth Miller did not meet Mr. Langley, however, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
could he learn where he was except that he wasn’t in
the Hollow. As a matter of fact Mr. Langley was
engaged in an affair of some moment.</p>

<p>He had left the parsonage early in the afternoon.
Directly after dinner, an informal, self-constituted
committee of three men living in the Farleigh end of
the village had waited on the minister in his study.
Though not taken wholly by surprise, he had been
shocked and distressed by the nature of their errand,
even while he could not but feel, as he assured them,
that they acted within their rights. He would have
persuaded them to wait until after Christmas, but he
could not insist upon it. And he was grateful to them
for coming to him and allowing him to forestall their
action so that it should be less shockingly abrupt to
those who must suffer thereby.</p>

<p>Hastening from the parsonage, he met Rusty and
Anna Miller in the phaeton driving the fat pony. As
he had already seen Rusty, he only greeted them in
passing. And realising at once that they were on their
way to Wenham to meet Reuben, he was thankful to
have them out of the way for a good measure of
time. His business was with Alice Lorraine, and the
fewer people he saw besides the girl herself, the quicker
might he dispatch it.</p>

<p>Unhappily, he did not find Alice at home. He
looked so concerned when Miss Penny told him that
the girl had gone away for the afternoon that Mrs.
Lorraine was startled.</p>

<p>“Is it something serious, Mr. Langley?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Yes, Mrs. Lorraine, it is indeed. May I ask if it
would be possible to get your daughter within half
an hour?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine feared not. Miss Penny made an
excuse and went out. As Mr. Langley resumed his
chair, Mrs. Lorraine turned to him despairingly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea where Alice is, Mr.
Langley. She left the house an hour ago. Anna and
Rusty Miller came over just as we were finishing
dinner, and when we looked for Alice she was not to
be found.”</p>

<p>“May I ask if she went in the direction of Farleigh?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think she did, Mr. Langley. As a matter
of fact, she practically always starts out in that direction,
but I do not think she did to-day for if she had
we should have seen her. Miss Penny and I both happened
to be where we saw everyone who passed over
that way for half an hour before we discovered she
wasn’t in the house.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have to trouble you, Mrs. Lorraine,”
he said gravely. “I am sorry. I would spare you if
I could, but even if I had seen Miss Lorraine first, you
would have had to know presently. May I ask you, in
the first place, whether you have allowed anyone to
occupy the cottage in the lane since you and your
daughter have been at Miss Penny’s?”</p>

<p>“O no, Mr. Langley,” she declared so decisively
that he frowned unconsciously. “We might as well
have given it up, only Alice thought we should keep
it until after Christmas. I suppose——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>But she could not go on. His expression disconcerted
her.</p>

<p>“And the little building in the rear that is called the
shop?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We never used that, anyhow,—never even looked
into it, though I believe we have the key.”</p>

<p>He picked up his gloves and looked inside as if to
determine the size. Then he looked at her.</p>

<p>“Three men came to me this noon about a matter
that has been troubling the village for some little time
and which now seems to them to be approaching a
crisis,” he began. “This is the situation, Mrs. Lorraine.
There has been a strange man around for—it
must be upwards of three weeks now. One person
and another has caught sight of him at night, and he
seems to have looked into the windows of nearly every
house in Farleigh. It may be imagination in some
cases, but before I had heard anything about the
stranger, I felt quite sure one night that there was
someone peering in at my study window, and I
certainly saw someone slink away from another window
at the parsonage about a fortnight since. Someone
saw the figure of a man pass across the window
in the organ loft at the church one Sunday afternoon,
and there have been other similar things—not of great
moment when taken separately but which collectively
seem to these men and others to constitute a menace to
public safety.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Langley, what has that to do with my—with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> 
the cottage in the lane?” she enquired with a sharp
note of pain in her voice.</p>

<p>“They seem to think that the man has hidden there
the while. Smoke has been seen a number of times
coming from the chimney of the little shop. At first
people explained it by saying that Miss Lorraine probably
had gone down to fetch something and had made
a fire to take off the chill, but lately one thing and
another has led them to suspect that that isn’t the right
explanation.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of tramps occupying deserted houses,”
she remarked.</p>

<p>He had nothing to say. She grew very white. “Did
you ask for Alice simply to spare me, Mr. Langley?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Lorraine,” he replied reluctantly, “it was
because I hoped she might be able to throw some light
upon the matter. It appears almost certain that she
knows something about this mystery in our midst.
She has been seen more or less about the lane, and—I
don’t credit the particular rumor people have patched
up, but——”</p>

<p>“And what is that, Mr. Langley?” she broke in
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“They think Alice’s father—that Mr. Lorraine is
hereabout—that he has been staying in the shop
behind the cottage and that his daughter carries him
food and visits him daily.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds, Mrs. Lorraine was too dazed to
speak. Alice’s strange conduct seemed to accord with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
this tale, and yet—she rallied her forces. It was impossible.</p>

<p>“Alice hears from her father. She had a letter only
a day or two ago,” she declared. But even as she
spoke, she realised that that wasn’t valid evidence.
She knit her brows, then looked up. “But Mr. Langley,
if Mr. Lorraine had escaped, why wouldn’t it have
been in the papers?” she demanded. “You say this has
been going on over three weeks, and—Mr. Lorraine
was—well-known.”</p>

<p>“I said something of the sort to these gentlemen,” he
returned. “They claimed that such an escape is often
kept secret for a time for strategical reasons. But
irrespective of that, there is no doubt that someone
has been skulking about the village, and that your shop
building has been occupied and probably by that person.
But for more than a week everything was quiet.
No smoke was seen and no one saw any suspicious
person and it was decided that the mysterious stranger
had departed. But night before last something happened
to arouse suspicion again. The men who came
to me declare that the tramp or stranger came back at
that time and is still here. They say he is in your shop
at this moment. The building is being watched now,
and they are only awaiting my return to enter and
arrest whomever they may find within.”</p>

<p>He rose. “You know nothing about it, Mrs. Lorraine,
but there’s nothing to do but to allow them to
proceed?”</p>

</figure>

<p>“No. Mr. Langley, there isn’t,” she acknowledged,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>and asked him if he was going thither. And when he
said that he was she asked if she might go along. He
acquiesced. After she had spoken to Miss Penny, Mr.
Langley handed her into the carriage and they drove
to the lane where the minister gave the horse in charge
to someone standing about. Going straight to the shop,
they found the three men Mr. Langley had seen and the
constable.</p>

<p>The latter pounded on the door preliminary to breaking
it in. He waited a few seconds. The echoes of
the thundering knocks had hardly died away when the
door opened and Alice Lorraine appeared before the
five men and her mother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PUSHING by Alice Lorraine, deaf to her entreaties,
the constable and two of the men made their way
into the shop and after an hasty glance about the lower
room hastened upstairs. Mr. Langley, after a brief
word to Mrs. Lorraine, followed. And despite his
haste and excitement and perturbation, he noticed the
homelike appearance of the place he recollected as a
littered work shop.</p>

<p>But of the upper chamber he noted no detail. As
his head rose above the railing of the stair, he saw the
men start back from the further end of the place.
Peering into the shadows, he saw the figure of a man
stretched upon an old couch. Approaching, he saw
that he was burning with fever and unconscious. The
man, who was very tall, was not at all the tramp in
appearance, though he seemed to have slept in his
clothes. He was well dressed and a superficial view
pronounced him of refined presence. He was like a
skeleton, however, and his purple face cadaverous to
the extreme.</p>

<p>Mr. Langley asked one of the men to go for the
doctor, sending Mrs. Lorraine up as he went. The
constable said he would wait below. The other man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
took a chair in the further end of the room as Mrs.
Lorraine joined Mr. Langley by the couch.</p>

<p>“Do you know this man?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I never saw him in my life,” she declared, and
going to the stairs, summoned Alice. The girl
appeared, white as chalk.</p>

<p>“Alice, do you know this man,” demanded the
mother sternly.</p>

<p>“I know him, certainly!” cried the girl defiantly.
“He is—he is a gentleman. He has done no one any
harm. He came to Farleigh to look for someone he
knew once, and I told him he might stay here.”</p>

<p>“But if he is a gentleman, how came you here, Alice
Lorraine?” cried her mother.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been here long, and—how could he know
it! Look at him, will you!” the girl cried. But her
mother continued to look sternly upon her.</p>

<p>“He went away,” the girl forced herself to explain.
“He was coming back before he went West where he
lives now. He didn’t come and—I was afraid something
had—happened. I came down this afternoon to
look once more and found him—just so. O Mr. Langley,
is he dying, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t judge so. I should say he was in the
early stage of a fever. He is terribly emaciated. He
looks starved. The doctor will be here shortly.
Meantime let me see if I can loosen his clothing a bit.”</p>

<p>As he bent over the couch, Alice’s heart went out to
him. He seemed so gentle and tender though he had
no idea the man was not a stranger and probably
believed him to be a tramp. As he put his arm beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the sick man’s shoulders to change his position, the
latter opened his eyes wide. Mr. Langley started but
finished what he was about.</p>

<p>The doctor came up and Mrs. Lorraine and Alice
went below. After some little time Mr. Langley
joined them.</p>

<p>“It is probably pneumonia, or will be within a few
hours,” he announced. “Dr. Porter will send for the
ambulance and have him taken to the hospital at
Wenham where he will have the best of care.”</p>

<p>He turned to Alice with a kind look.</p>

<p>“O mother, couldn’t we take him into the cottage
and take care of him?” cried the girl beseechingly.
“He is good and—O, so unfortunate, and—O if you
knew something I know, you couldn’t refuse. And—if
Mr. Langley knew—something else, he would beg
you to.”</p>

<p>Mr. Langley looked at the girl with an odd expression
on his face.</p>

<p>“The man’s eyes are exactly like those of a dear
friend of mine who has been dead these six years,”
he said keeping his own eyes upon her the while. “For
a moment I forgot all and thought he was Dick
Cartwright.”</p>

<p>Alice wrung her hands.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Alice Lorraine, who is the man above?
Is it indeed Dick Cartwright?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Langley, it is,” the girl owned with a
great sense of relief. “He didn’t die. It was another
man, but he gave him his name because he wished to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
be dead. He only came here to see you and Reuben.
Then he was going back again. I—happened upon
him one day and—after that I tried to help him. He is
really——”</p>

<p>Mr. Langley was half way up the stair. Mrs. Lorraine
stopped him. “Tell the doctor we will take him
into the cottage,” she bade him. “Alice and I will go
right over to get a bed ready.”</p>

<p>They got the bed ready and Mr. Langley and the
doctor carried the sick man over, undressed him and
got him into it. The doctor secured a nurse and Mr.
Langley waited until she should come. Meanwhile
Alice Lorraine related to him and to her mother the
whole story Dick Cartwright had told her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine remained at the cottage, while Alice
returned to Miss Penny’s. When Mr. Langley took
her over he told Miss Penny briefly who the sick man
was, and they discussed the situation as it concerned
Reuben, who was fortunately out of the house at that
moment.</p>

<p>They decided to say nothing to him until after
Christmas when Mr. Langley would tell him the whole
story. Reuben could then, if he wished, stay at the
cottage for the remainder of his holidays.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Reuben was to remain there
considerably longer than that. When it was time for
him to return to college his father was just out of
danger and Reuben did not dream of leaving him. He
did not, indeed, return to college again until the following
autumn. As soon as Dick Cartwright was able to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
about the house, Mrs. Lorraine returned to Miss
Penny’s, and Reuben and his father took the cottage
as their home. Reuben got a position in the bank at
Wenham and went back and forth to his work happily.
His father kept house. As he grew stronger, Mr.
Langley persuaded him to practice on the church
organ. In the late spring, he was back again in his
old position of organist at Farleigh church, and in
the summer he secured, with Mr. Langley’s help, the
position to teach music in the public schools at
Wenham. This gave him a sufficient income not only
to live comfortably but to pay Reuben’s expenses at
college. Reuben, however, still preferred to work his
way through, so the money was saved towards the
pipe organ.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To return now to Mr. Langley and the day before
Christmas—that Christmas which was to be the happiest
of his life.</p>

<p>He hadn’t realised that he was tired until he opened
his own gate late that afternoon. Then suddenly such
a dead weight of fatigue dropped down upon him
that he felt as if he couldn’t crawl to his own door.
Certainly he could never attain the sanctuary of his
study where he could think over the events of the
afternoon and realise the joy that had come to him
with the return of his friend as it were from the
gates of death.</p>

<p>Someone came to the door and peered eagerly up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
the street. It was Anna Miller. Forgetting himself,
Mr. Langley called to her and hurried up the steps.</p>

<p>“O Anna, is anything wrong?” he asked anxiously,
for he would have thought of her as being somewhere
with Rusty and Reuben.</p>

<p>“Wrong!” the girl echoed with ringing voice and
beaming face. “O Mr. Langley, everything is so
beautifully right that it seemed as if you would never,
never come. O hurry, please.”</p>

<p>She led him, not as he expected, towards his wife’s
door, but into the front room across the passage from
the study. It had been the parlour but was seldom
used now-a-days.</p>

<p>It looked exceedingly cheerful now, but so would
the cellar have looked to Mr. Langley had the potato-bin
held the same group that he saw on the brocaded
sofa. Mrs. Langley, bright and alert with flushed
cheeks and not uncomely, despite Seth Miller’s opinion,
sat thereon with Joe, Junior, curled up beside her while
Big Bell hung over them, trying now to make herself
inconspicuous and really appearing to be twice her
natural size.</p>

<p>As the minister paused on the threshold, his wife
looked up and smiled. She had actually learned since
noon to smile. Or it may be that she had recollected
her old smile of twenty-odd years ago, for she looked
to Russell Langley at that moment like the bride of
his youth, or rather like little Ella May’s mother.</p>

<p>“Russell, what do you think! Anna has offered us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
this precious baby as a Christmas gift!” she cried
eagerly. “Shall we accept?”</p>

<p>He put Anna into the most comfortable chair in the
room and moved it close to the sofa. Then he seated
himself the other side of the baby whom he bent to
kiss. And little Joe repeated what no doubt seemed
to him the pass-word for this household, “baa-baa!”</p>

<p>Mr. Langley turned eagerly to the girl.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it, Anna?” he asked with such a look
in his eyes that Anna could not answer. But she
nodded, smiling through tears.</p>

<p>He took the baby into his arms and caressed it.</p>

<p>“I can’t—we can’t begin to tell Anna how happy we
shall be nor how grateful we are to her, can we Ella?”
he said warmly.</p>

<p>“We’ll certainly jump at the chance,” Mrs. Langley
rejoined, borrowing Anna’s phraseology with such
comical effect that they all laughed merrily. And little
Joe smiled confidently into Anna’s eyes.</p>
